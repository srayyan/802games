		<h1>Gauss's Law Flux</h1>
		 
         	<p>This JavaScript simulation illustrateS Gauss's Law for a spherical or cylindrical imaginary Gaussian surface, in the presence of positive (orange) or negative (blue) point charges. You begin with one positive charge and one negative charge in the scene. You can add additional positive or negative charges using the Control Panel, or delete all charges present and start again. The charges can be moved around by left clicking and dragging on the charge. A charge that is selected by left clicking turns a lighter color. You can select multiple charges to move about by "ctrl left clicking" on successive charges. You can use the radio buttons on the Control Panel to choose whether your imaginary closed Gaussian surface is a cylinder or a sphere. You can move your Gaussian surface around and change its orientation by using the sliders in the Control Panel. You will see normals to the Gaussian surface (gray arrows) at many points on the surface (see figure at bottom of the page). At those same points you will see the local electric field on the surface due to all the charges in the scene. If you left click and drag in the view, your perspective will change so that you can see the field vector and normal orientation better. If you want to return to the original view hit the "Reset View" button in the Control Panel
</p>
	
	<p>Click and drag using the left mouse button to rotate. Click and drag using the right mouse button (or use SHIFT + left mouse button) to change the center of view. And click and drag using the mouse wheel (or use CTRL + left mouse button) to zoom in/out. The two spheres can be selected and dragged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
