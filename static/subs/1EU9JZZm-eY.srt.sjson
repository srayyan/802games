    "WALTER LEWIN: So the flux, phi B, is defined as the integral", 
    "of B dot dA over this open surface.", 
    "Flux is a scalar.", 
    "It's plus or it's minus or it's 0.", 
    "Flux has no direction.", 
    "So the flux, in this case, would be x y, which is the", 
    "area of this loop since the magnetic field is uniform.", 
    "That's a very easy integral, and then I get the magnetic", 
    "field B, and then I get the cosine of the angle.", 
    "So now, according to Faraday, it is the time derivative of", 
    "this quantity that determines the EMF.", 
    "You can do that in several ways.", 
    "You could have a dB/dt, change in the magnetic field.", 
    "This is the area, A, of the loop.", 
    "You could change the area.", 
    "You could have a dA/dt but you can also change theta.", 
    "You could have a d theta/dt, and I will", 
    "look at those today.", 
    "This number here, the way I have chosen my dA, is a", 
    "positive number.", 
    "If somehow, this number increases in positive value,", 
    "the induced current that is going to run will try to", 
    "create a magnetic field to oppose the change.", 
    "So in that case, if the flux, which is now positive, is", 
    "getting larger positive, then the current that is going to", 
    "run will be in this direction.", 
    "That's Lenz for you.", 
    "So it creates, by itself, this current will create a magnetic", 
    "field in this direction.", 
    "And if the magnetic flux, which is now positive the way", 
    "I've defined it, were decreasing, then the current", 
    "would go the other way around.", 
    "Last time I did several demonstrations whereby we", 
    "changed B, we had dB/dt's.", 
    "And there was one particular demonstration that blew your", 
    "mind, and that you will tell your grandchildren about, and", 
    "that you will always remember, I hope.", 
    "Today, I'm going to change theta, and I'm going to change", 
    "the area, which will also give me then induced EMFs, and", 
    "therefore, induced currents into a closed conducting loop.", 
    "So let me make another drawing of the closed conducting loop.", 
    "This has length, y, and width, x, and I'm", 
    "going to rotate this.", 
    "My idea is you can see this three dimensionally.", 
    "I'm going to rotate this about this axis with angular", 
    "frequency, omega.", 
    "Omega is 2pi divided by the period.", 
    "The period is the time of one rotation.", 
    "Normally, we choose for that capital T. I don't want to do", 
    "that today because T can confuse you with Tesla.", 
    "And so I'm going to rotate this around.", 
    "So the angle theta, that you have there, theta then becomes", 
    "theta 0 plus omega t, going back to 8.01.", 
    "And I choose this theta 0 such that a t 0, I choose my theta", 
    "to be 0, and so I have nothing to do with theta 0.", 
    "So what now is the magnetic flux?", 
    "This is my loop.", 
    "I have to commit myself to a surface.", 
    "Well, I will just choose this flat surface,", 
    "just like I did there.", 
    "I chose that flat surface.", 
    "I'm free to choose any surface, why not", 
    "taking the flat one?", 
    "And so the flux through that flat surface is then the area", 
    "which is x times y, that's the area of this loop.", 
    "And then I have the magnetic field.", 
    "And then I have cosine omega t.", 
    "Maxwell tells me it's not the flux that matters, it is the", 
    "change in the flux that matters.", 
    "OK, so d phi/dt.", 
    "I've got the A, the area.", 
    "I've got the magnetic field.", 
    "Omega pops out, and I get a sine of omega t, and I get a", 
    "minus sign.", 
    "Normally, I don't care about minus signs because I'm only", 
    "interested in the magnitude of the induced EMF.", 
    "I always know in which direction the", 
    "current will flow.", 
    "I really do.", 
    "Because I know Lenz's law.", 
    "So you should never have too many hang ups", 
    "on those minus signs.", 
    "But since I'm getting a minus sign out of this now here, it", 
    "will be a little foolish not to put a minus here and make", 
    "this into a plus because that then, according to Faraday, is", 
    "immediately the EMF.", 
    "And the EMF is changing with time because you have the sine", 
    "omega t in here.", 
    "And so the current that is going to flow, the induced", 
    "current, which will also be time dependent, is the EMF", 
    "divided by the resistance in the loop.", 
    "And this is the total resistance", 
    "of that entire network.", 
    "That could be light bulbs in there.", 
    "That could be resistances in there.", 
    "It's the total resistance.", 
    "And this current, when I rotate this loop, is going to", 
    "alternate in a sinusoidal fashion.", 
    "And we call that alternating current, AC.", 
    "That's what's coming out of the wall, AC.", 
    "Suppose this loop was double, and what I mean by double, is", 
    "the following.", 
    "That it works like this.", 
    "Follow my picture closely.", 
    "I will go slowly.", 
    "Like this, like this, like this, so, back,", 
    "and I close it here.", 
    "So it's one closed loop, but I have two windings.", 
    "I have to attach a surface through this closed loop.", 
    "That's mandatory.", 
    "Faraday insists.", 
    "I attached an open surface to this closed loop.", 
    "What would it look like?", 
    "Well, I advise you to take that, dip it in", 
    "soap and look at it.", 
    "And what you will see then, because the soap will attach", 
    "everywhere to the closed loop, you're", 
    "going to see one surface.", 
    "It's not two separate surface.", 
    "You don't have two separate loops.", 
    "It's one surface, but sort of two layers.", 
    "One is lower and the other one comes on top.", 
    "And so the magnetic flux will double now because you're", 
    "going to see that this magnetic field penetrates both", 
    "this soap film and the one that is below.", 
    "And so you get twice the EMF.", 
    "And if you have N windings in one closed loop, capital N,", 
    "then the EMF that you get would be N times larger.", 
    "And you can make N 1,000.", 
    "There is no problem with that.", 
    "I'm going to do a demonstration for you whereby", 
    "I'm going to use the Earth's magnetic field, and a loop,", 
    "that you see here.", 
    "It has 42 windings.", 
    "So my capital N is 42.", 
    "Not just 2 like here, but 42.", 
    "And it is circular, it has a radius, I think it's about 30", 
    "centimeters.", 
    "Here you have it.", 
    "It's about 30 centimeters.", 
    "So the area, pi r squared, which is my capital A, pi r", 
    "squared is about 0.28 square meters.", 
    "You may want to check that.", 
    "I use the Earth's magnetic field, which is about half a", 
    "Gauss, so that's about 5 times 10 to the -5 Tesla, if we work", 
    "in SI units.", 
    "And I'm going to rotate it around with the periods of", 
    "about one second.", 
    "That means omega, 2pi divided by the period, is then about", 
    "six radians per second.", 
    "2pi, I call that 6 for now.", 
    "And so what is the EMF that I'm going to get when I rotate", 
    "it once around per second?", 
    "Well, the EMF will change as a function of time."
