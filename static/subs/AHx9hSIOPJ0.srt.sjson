    "WALTER LEWIN: These equations only satisfy Maxwell's", 
    "equations under two conditions.", 
    "And one condition is that B 0 is E 0 divided by c.", 
    "And the other condition is that omega divided by k, which", 
    "is the velocity with which it propagates, I will", 
    "call that c in vacuum.", 
    "We call the velocity of electromagnetic radiation c.", 
    "If that is 1 divided by the square root of epsilon 0 mu 0.", 
    "If that's the case, my two equations will satisfy", 
    "Maxwell's equations.", 
    "Imagine the victory for Maxwell.", 
    "Maxwell was not only able to predict the existence of", 
    "electromagnetic waves, but he was even able to predict that", 
    "they would move through vacuum with that speed.", 
    "What an unbelievable victory when you come to think of it", 
    "that epsilon 0 can be measured in a static way.", 
    "It follows from Coulomb's law.", 
    "It has nothing to do with the dB/dt.", 
    "It's nothing to do with the dE/dt.", 
    "It's nothing to do with travelling waves.", 
    "Epsilon 0 is about 8.85 times 10 to the -12 in SI units.", 
    "Mu 0 is equally static.", 
    "It can be measured from the force at which two wires,", 
    "through which you run a current, attract each other.", 
    "No dB/dt.", 
    "No dE/dt.", 
    "It has nothing to do with electromagnetic waves.", 
    "Mu 0 is about 1.26 times 10 to the -6 in SI units.", 
    "And if you multiply them and substitute them in this", 
    "equation, you will find that c equals 2.99 times 10 to the 8", 
    "meters per second.", 
    "Unbelievable.", 
    "What a success for that theory.", 
    "It always baffles me how two quantities so static and", 
    "seemingly so unrelated to moving waves, with dB/dt's and", 
    "the dE/dt's all over the place, how they can predict", 
    "the speed of light.", 
    "Suppose I ask you to measure the pressure in your tires of", 
    "your car, and I would ask you to also measure the voltage of", 
    "your battery and then to predict the speed of the car.", 
    "It's almost something like that.", 
    "It is bizarre, but it works and it was a great victory and", 
    "of course, it justified, entirely, this one term, which", 
    "is this displacement current term.", 
    "Together, you and I, will prove that this is indeed a", 
    "necessary condition so that these equations satisfy", 
    "Maxwell's equations.", 
    "We will do it together.", 
    "I will do 50% and you will do the other 50% at assignment", 
    "number nine.", 
    "So we split this bill 50-50.", 
    "I will make a new drawing and I will do something that I", 
    "rarely ever do in lectures, I will give you eight minutes of", 
    "hardcore math.", 
    "You're going to hate it.", 
    "I'm going to make a new drawing, which is not too", 
    "different from what you have there.", 
    "So this is z, this is x, and this is y, and the t equals 0.", 
    "I'm going to draw here the electric field like so.", 
    "So this is E 0, electric field is this strength.", 
    "And now I'm going to apply Ampere's law.", 
    "That's my half of the bargain.", 
    "Closed loop integral of B dot dl--", 
    "you see there--", 
    "equals epsilon 0 times mu 0 times d phi E/dt.", 
    "We're dealing with vacuums so kappa m is 1 and the", 
    "dielectric constant is 1.", 
    "And there is no such thing as a current I because we are an", 
    "empty space.", 
    "So this whole term does not exist.", 
    "What does Ampere's law require?", 
    "I need a closed loop and I need a surface that I attach,", 
    "an open surface, to that closed loop.", 
    "I'm going to choose a closed loop in the plane y z.", 
    "And this is going to be my closed loop.", 
    "This here, is going to be my closed loop.", 
    "This length is l and the width this side is", 
    "lambda divided by 4.", 
    "I have to do a closed loop integral B dot dl.", 
    "I will do that last.", 
    "I will first do the hardest part, which is the time", 
    "derivative of the electric flux through this surface.", 
    "The problem is that the electric", 
    "field is not constant.", 
    "The electric field is 0 here and has a maximum here and", 
    "falls off in this way.", 
    "So I have to do an integral.", 
    "So I'm going to make a slice here and this slice", 
    "here has a width dz.", 
    "And in that very narrow slice, the electric field is", 
    "approximately constant.", 
    "Right here, the electric field has this value.", 
    "But everywhere in that slice, it has the same value because,", 
    "remember, it's a plane wave.", 
    "And so I will draw here a line parallel.", 
    "And so everywhere in that slice the electric field has", 
    "exactly this value and that value is", 
    "given by this equation.", 
    "If you tell me what z is, at time t equals 0 I know what", 
    "that value is.", 
    "That's this value.", 
    "So now I have to calculate the electric flux.", 
    "So phi of E, I have to take the dot product between dA and", 
    "the electric field.", 
    "Remember, flux is a dot product, E times dA.", 
    "I will choose dA up because E is also up so", 
    "that makes life easy.", 
    "I have to remember that later then, when I do the closed", 
    "loop integral B dot dl, when looking from below I have to", 
    "go clockwise because I remember the right-hand", 
    "corkscrew rule.", 
    "So I get all my minus signs and plus signs just right.", 
    "So dA and E are in the same direction.", 
    "So what is dA of this little slice?", 
    "That is l times dz.", 
    "So I get l times dz.", 
    "What is the local electric field in this slice?", 
    "Well that's that equation.", 
    "So I get E 0 times the cosine of k z minus omega t.", 
    "This x roof, of course, is gone because dA and E are in", 
    "the same direction.", 
    "I've already taken that into account.", 
    "But I have to integrate this now from z equals 0 to lambda", 
    "over 4 because I have to integrate", 
    "over this whole surface.", 
    "So that's the answer but I'm not interested in phi E. I", 
    "have to know d phi E/dt.", 
    "So it's going to be work for you.", 
    "I told you eight minutes.", 
    "Pain in the neck.", 
    "So I'm going to take the time derivative of that function,", 
    "so d phi E/dt.", 
    "l and E 0 can come out.", 
    "That's no problem.", 
    "They are constants.", 
    "I take the time derivative of cosine k z minus omega t, then", 
    "minus omega pops out.", 
    "And the cosine becomes a minus sine.", 
    "So I get minus the sine of k z minus omega t.", 
    "And I have to do an integral.", 
    "Here is my dz from 0 to lambda over 4.", 
    "This minus sign eats up this minus sign.", 
    "I have to do the integral but I do that at t equals 0.", 
    "In other words, this thing goes away because t equals 0.", 
    "So I'm getting close.", 
    "So I'm going to continue here.", 
    "So I get l times E 0.", 
    "I have an omega and now I have to do the", 
    "integral of sine k z dz."
