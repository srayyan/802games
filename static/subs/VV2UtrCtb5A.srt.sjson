    "And the way I have this demonstration is that this is", 
    "completely open.", 
    "So I only show you immediately the value of V2.", 
    "I show you this value.", 
    "It has a huge value of a resistance, several megaohms.", 
    "So for sure, I don't meet this condition.", 
    "But that condition is not necessary for this to hold.", 
    "That condition is necessary for this to hold,", 
    "not for this to hold.", 
    "So I have no fears that I'm going to be embarrassed.", 
    "So I'm going to put one--", 
    "this is a very long wire--", 
    "I'm going to put one loop around there.", 
    "I'm now powering this solenoid.", 
    "There's an iron core in there--", 
    "60 hertz, 110 volts.", 
    "And there we go, one loop around it.", 
    "I measure 0.48 volts.", 
    "That's not bad.", 
    "Now I put two, three, four around it.", 
    "What do I see now?", 
    "I see 1.996.", 
    "You may not see the six.", 
    "It's very close to 2.", 
    "What I will do now, I will move it up a little.", 
    "And when I move it up a little, the secondary, the", 
    "flux coupling, is not ideal anymore.", 
    "And so you expect that V2 will go down.", 
    "Just move it up a little along the primary.", 
    "And you see, the value goes down.", 
    "Because now the flux coupling is not ideal.", 
    "And if I bring it further out, the flux", 
    "coupling becomes hopeless.", 
    "And when I bring it here, the flux coupling is so poor-- but", 
    "I still get 0.3 volts, by the way.", 
    "So that's the first part, to show you that this is indeed", 
    "quite accurate.", 
    "Now I want to do a second part, and that is more", 
    "interesting.", 
    "I'm going to try to convince you that I can get a secondary", 
    "current which is huge--", 
    "maybe even 1,000 amperes.", 
    "But now I have to take special precautions.", 
    "I have to do the experiment in a very different way.", 
    "And the way I'm going to do this experiment now is with a", 
    "secondary which is specially designed to have an enormously", 
    "low value of resistance.", 
    "Because I want to approach this situation so that this", 
    "approximately holds.", 
    "We have a very thick copper secondary, almost", 
    "half an inch thick.", 
    "It's like so.", 
    "This is copper.", 
    "And I put here a nail, an iron nail.", 
    "And the resistance of this iron nail is about 4 times 10", 
    "to the -4 ohms.", 
    "The self-inductance of this ring--", 
    "purely geometry, it's nothing to do with the kind of", 
    "material I have--", 
    "is easy to estimate.", 
    "I made a calculation and I found about 5 times", 
    "10 to the -7 henry.", 
    "So omega times L2--", 
    "I have to multiply this by 377--", 
    "becomes about 2 times 10 to the -4 ohms.", 
    "Even though R2 is not much, much smaller than omega L2,", 
    "they are now beginning to be comparable.", 
    "But I1, the current that I drive in the primary is going", 
    "to be 20 amperes.", 
    "I do not expect that I2 will be 220 times larger than I1", 
    "because I use the same 220 windings for the coil and this", 
    "is just one winding.", 
    "So I have the same ratio N1/N2 that I had before in that", 
    "experiment when I did N2 equals 1.", 
    "I don't expect that this is going to be 220 times 20", 
    "amperes, which would be about 4,400 amperes.", 
    "Because I am really not in the domain that R is much, much", 
    "smaller than omega L. But I probably get", 
    "500 to 1,000 amperes.", 
    "And if my current, I2, becomes 500 to 1,000 amperes, you can", 
    "calculate what I squared R2 is.", 
    "Because you know R2, that's all in that nail.", 
    "And that comes out to be about 100 to 400 watts.", 
    "You better believe that that nail is going to be red hot,", 
    "it's going to glow and probably melt.", 
    "And this is the idea behind so-called induction ovens.", 
    "This is purposefully done to get a very high temperature.", 
    "It's also done in welding to get very high currents.", 
    "And so the second part of the", 
    "demonstration is the same primary.", 
    "I want to make it dark so that you can see the", 
    "glowing of that nail.", 
    "And I will also show you, of course, first the--", 
    "so here is the coil and here is my secondary.", 
    "This is that very thick copper.", 
    "And now you see the nail here.", 
    "Make sure there's no current, my god, I almost shoved it", 
    "over there.", 
    "Thank goodness that I realized that there was current.", 
    "So the current is now not going through the solenoid.", 
    "And so here is the secondary now.", 
    "Put some pieces of wood under there so that", 
    "you can see it better.", 
    "And so now if I power the primary, I can't tell you", 
    "exactly what the current is through the secondary, but", 
    "it's probably somewhere in the vicinity between", 
    "500 and 1,000 amperes.", 
    "It will glow.", 
    "It may take one minute to melt.", 
    "It may not melt at all.", 
    "It may take three seconds.", 
    "Unpredictable, because we don't know exactly the", 
    "resistance of that nail.", 
    "So I will tell you when I do it.", 
    "I will count down.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero.", 
    "It's already gone.", 
    "That was fast.", 
    "So you saw a glowing and you can actually see", 
    "that the nail melted.", 
    "So you've seen an example now where the current", 
    "is immensely high.", 
    "So now I want to discuss with you another practical", 
    "application which has immediate consequences, or", 
    "applications, I should say, in your cars.", 
    "Spark plugs--", 
    "cars have coils.", 
    "And coils are run by a car battery which is DC.", 
    "It's not AC.", 
    "But you've got to get high voltage to get", 
    "a spark going in--", 
    "spark plug.", 
    "And that's done in a very clever way.", 
    "So here is my 12-volt battery.", 
    "There's always some resistance, of", 
    "course, in the circuit.", 
    "If you have a coil, you always have some finite resistance.", 
    "And here is a coil.", 
    "And here is a switch.", 
    "And this has N1 windings at a certain self inductance, the", 
    "same situation that we had before.", 
    "And then I have here a secondary where I have N2", 
    "windings, which is way, way larger than N1.", 
    "I close the switch.", 
    "The current is going to build up.", 
    "And the time constant is L/R seconds.", 
    "We discussed that before.", 
    "It's going to build up.", 
    "And now I'm going to do something extremely cruel.", 
    "I'm going to open this circuit, open the switch.", 
    "Imagine what I'm doing.", 
    "I'm cutting instantaneously the current.", 
    "The current is going happily, reaches a maximum value after", 
    "several L/R seconds.", 
    "And now I open it up.", 
    "So I get a huge value for dI1/dt.", 
    "I1 is now the current in the primary.", 
    "The current, of course, will die down on a time scale L/R,", 
    "which is the new value for R. And the new value for R is the", 
    "fact that I open it up, I make the resistance infinitely", 
    "large here.", 
    "And if the resistance is infinitely large here, my L/R", 
    "time goes to zero.", 
    "So that makes you see indeed why dI1/dt becomes enormous.", 
    "With a 12-volt battery, you could easily get several", 
    "hundred volts EMF now because the dI1/dt will of course", 
    "create an EMF, an induced EMF in that circuit.", 
    "Because you get d phi/dt.", 
    "You get an enormous change in the magnetic flux here, which", 
    "is directly coupled to the current.", 
    "And that induced EMF could be several hundred volts.", 
    "But now look at the secondary.", 
    "The secondary has an N2 which is way larger than N1.", 
    "So the induced EMF in the secondary is very roughly", 
    "N2/N1 times the induced EMF in the primary.", 
    "That was the ratio that we had earlier, the V2/V1,", 
    "remember, was N2/N1.", 
    "So now I get in the secondary an absolutely horrendous", 
    "potential difference.", 
    "I could get up to a million volts if I want to.", 
    "In your cars, that is not necessary.", 
    "It is enough in your cars that you get here", 
    "something like 10 kilovolts.", 
    "And that will comfortably give you a spark", 
    "over your spark plug.", 
    "And so what is happening with your car without you realizing", 
    "it, there is a circuit that closes and opens and closes", 
    "and opens and closes and opens.", 
    "And it's only when you open it that you get this pathetic", 
    "high voltage here and that the spark flies over.", 
    "And if you run your engine at 3,000 RPM and you have a four", 
    "cylinder, that happens 200 times per second.", 
    "But it is the breaking that does it.", 
    "And I can demonstrate this to you.", 
    "We have a very special spark plug.", 
    "Maybe it should not be called spark plug.", 
    "It's a beautiful device.", 
    "You'll see it all the way over there.", 
    "And we have there a situation whereby we don't even know", 
    "what N2/N1 is.", 
    "This is ancient work of art, probably built in the 19th", 
    "century or maybe early 20th century.", 
    "We think that N2/N1 is at least several thousand.", 
    "But let's say--", 
    "it is 10 to the 3, but it could be way higher than that.", 
    "We don't know.", 
    "And we run it with a car battery just like your car--", 
    "12 volts.", 
    "We let the current build up in the primary just", 
    "like we have here.", 
    "And then in a very cruel way, we open the primary.", 
    "And we create in the secondary up to 300,000, 400,000,", 
    "500,000 volts.", 
    "And then what you will see, you will see a spark fly over", 
    "here at 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 volts.", 
    "You can draw a spark over a distance of", 
    "10 centimeters easily.", 
    "Because all you have to do is get above 3 million volts per", 
    "meter which is the breakdown electric field.", 
    "And this is what I want to show you now.", 
    "And for that, I also have to make it a little dark.", 
    "Because if you want to see sparks, of course you want to", 
    "keep it-- make it a little dark.", 
    "So this is the way we are going to do it.", 
    "Maybe you want to take a look at that beautiful coil first.", 
    "It's there.", 
    "So this is the whole set up.", 
    "Here you see the car battery there, just 12 volts.", 
    "And here you see the secondary.", 
    "This is the open end of the secondary.", 
    "Those two little balls that I have there.", 
    "And all of this is enclosed.", 
    "We cannot measure very much.", 
    "And so now I will change the lights for you.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I'm now running a current through the primary.", 
    "And that current is about--", 
    "oh, we don't even know what the current is.", 
    "I can't tell you.", 
    "All I can tell you is now I will open up the current in", 
    "the primary, so--", 
    "boy, I didn't mean to kill myself, but", 
    "I did in the process.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I open up the switch.", 
    "And every time that I open it, you see there this enormous", 
    "voltage at the secondary.", 
    "This is the way that your car coil works and that you get", 
    "sparks to your spark plug.", 
    "That is an enormous potential difference there.", 
    "We can also set this in such a way that it opens and closes", 
    "without my having to do it manually.", 
    "And then you see--", 
    "you get an idea of how your spark plug works.", 
    "But that's not the reason why I showed it to you.", 
    "This is such a wonderful piece of engineering and a lot of", 
    "research was done in the early part of the 20th century with", 
    "instruments like this.", 
    "It was named after the person who invented", 
    "this, which is Ruhmkorff.", 
    "And when I was a student, we always referred to this", 
    "instrument as the Ruhmkorff.", 
    "We'll let it go so when you walk out, you can come close.", 
    "But be very careful.", 
    "You're dealing there with several", 
    "hundred thousand volts.", 
    "OK, have a good weekend."
