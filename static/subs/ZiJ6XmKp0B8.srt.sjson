    "WALTER LEWIN: It's sort of like twisting", 
    "the neck of a goose.", 
    "You get something like this.", 
    "And so you have here a surface,", 
    "which has a point here.", 
    "And it is exactly at that point where the", 
    "electric field is zero.", 
    "That does not mean that the potential is zero.", 
    "Of course not.", 
    "The potential is positive here.", 
    "If you come with a positive charge from the lobby seven", 
    "and you have to march up to that point, you have to do", 
    "positive work.", 
    "You have to overcome both the repelling force from the +4", 
    "and the repelling force from the +1.", 
    "But finally, when you reach that point, you can rest", 
    "because there is no force on you at that point.", 
    "That's what it means that the electric field is zero.", 
    "It does not mean that you haven't done any work.", 
    "So never confuse electric fields with potentials.", 
    "I want to draw your attention to the fact that the green", 
    "lines, the field lines, are everywhere perpendicular to", 
    "the equipotentials.", 
    "I will get back to that during my next lecture.", 
    "That is not an accident.", 
    "That is always the case.", 
    "Now, Maxwell shows you something that is a little bit", 
    "more complicated.", 
    "Here, he calculated for us the equipotential surfaces, the", 
    "red ones are the surfaces.", 
    "Again, you have to rotate them about the vertical to make it", 
    "three-dimensional.", 
    "And now, we have a -1 charge and a +4.", 
    "And so, whenever it is red, the surface, the", 
    "potential is positive.", 
    "And whenever I have drawn it blue the", 
    "potential is negative.", 
    "First, if we were very far away from both the +4 and the", 
    "-1, you expect to be looking at a charge which is", 
    "effectively +3.", 
    "And so, if you go very far away, for sure, the potential", 
    "is everywhere positive.", 
    "And you expected them to be spherical again.", 
    "If you look here, you're very far away from", 
    "the +4 and the -1.", 
    "Indeed, this has already the shape of a sphere.", 
    "So that's clear.", 
    "That the +4 and the -1 far away behave like a +3.", 
    "If you're very close to the +4 you get nice spheres around", 
    "the +4, positive potential.", 
    "If you're very close to the -1, notice that the blue", 
    "surfaces are almost nice spheres, but", 
    "now they're all negative.", 
    "Because you're very close to the -1,", 
    "so a negative potential.", 
    "There is here one surface, which now has zero potential.", 
    "It has to be because if you're negative potential close to", 
    "the -1, and you have positive potential very far out, you've", 
    "got to go through a surface where it's zero.", 
    "And so, there is here a surface, I still have put it", 
    "in blue, which is actually everywhere on this surface,", 
    "the potential is zero.", 
    "Is the electric field zero there?", 
    "Absolutely not.", 
    "Electric field should not be confused with potential.", 
    "What it means is that if you take a test charge in your", 
    "pocket and you come from infinity.", 
    "And you walk to that surface, that by the time you have", 
    "reached that surface, you've done zero work.", 
    "That's what it means.", 
    "That the potential is zero.", 
    "There is here one point, which we discussed earlier in my", 
    "lectures, where the electric field is zero.", 
    "The potential is not zero there.", 
    "The potential is definitely positive here.", 
    "Because here was the zero surface.", 
    "Here is already positive surface.", 
    "And this is a positive surface.", 
    "So the potential is positive.", 
    "However, if you reach that point, there's no force on", 
    "your charge.", 
    "So that means electric field is zero.", 
    "It is not so easy, of course, to calculate these surfaces.", 
    "Maxwell was capable of doing that 110 years ago.", 
    "And nowadays, we can do that very easily with computers.", 
    "Equipotential surfaces, which have different values can", 
    "never intersect.", 
    "+5 volts surface can never intersect with a +3 or a +1.", 
    "And you think about why that is.", 
    "Why that is, it would be a total violation of the", 
    "conservation of energy.", 
    "So equipotential surfaces, different", 
    "values can never intersect.", 
    "All right, so you've seen that for the various charge", 
    "configurations the equipotential surfaces have", 
    "very complicated shapes and cannot always be calculated in", 
    "a very easy way.", 
    "Now comes the question why do we introduce electric", 
    "potentials?", 
    "Who needs them?", 
    "And who needs equipotential surfaces?", 
    "Isn't it true that if we know the electric field vector", 
    "everywhere in space that that determines, uniquely, how", 
    "charges will move, what acceleration they will obtain,", 
    "that means how their kinetic energy will change?", 
    "And the answer is, yeah.", 
    "If you know the electric field everywhere in space, sure,", 
    "then you can predict everything that happens with a", 
    "charge in that field.", 
    "But there are examples where electric fields are so", 
    "incredibly complicated that it is easier to work with the", 
    "equipotentials.", 
    "Because the change in kinetic energy, as I will discuss now,", 
    "really depends only on the change in the potential when", 
    "you go from one point to another.", 
    "So you will see very shortly that sometimes if you're only", 
    "interested in change of kinetic energy, and not", 
    "necessarily interested in the details of the trajectory,", 
    "then equipotentials come in very handy.", 
    "Never confuse U, which is electrostatic potential", 
    "energy, with V, which is electric potential.", 
    "This has unit joules.", 
    "And this has unit joules per coulomb, which we call volts.", 
    "If I have a collection of charges, pluses and minuses, U", 
    "has only one value.", 
    "It is the work that I have to do to put all these crazy", 
    "charges exactly where they are.", 
    "But the electric potential is different here, from there,", 
    "from there, to there, to there.", 
    "If you're very close to a plus charge, you can be sure that", 
    "the potential is positive.", 
    "If you're very close to a negative charge, you can be", 
    "sure that the potential is negative.", 
    "But U has only one number.", 
    "There's only one value.", 
    "They're both scalars.", 
    "Don't confuse one with the other.", 
    "In a gravitational field, matter, like a piece of chalk,", 
    "wants to go from high potential to low potential.", 
    "If I just release it with zero speed, there it goes, high", 
    "potential to low potential.", 
    "In analogy, positive charges will also go from a high", 
    "electric potential to a low electric potential.", 
    "And, of course, this is unique for electricity, negative", 
    "charges will go from a low potential to a", 
    "high electric potential.", 
    "Suppose I had a position A in space and I had another", 
    "position B. And I specify the potentials.", 
    "So here, we have A. Potential is VA.", 
    "And here we have point B, where the potential is VB.", 
    "By definition, the potential of VA, as we discussed before,", 
    "is the integral--", 
    "By the way, these are separated by some random", 
    "distance, r, whatever you want.", 
    "So the potential of A is defined as the integral in", 
    "going from A to infinity of E dot dr. That is the definition", 
    "of the potential of A. There is an E here, which is force", 
    "per unit charge.", 
    "So it is not work.", 
    "If they were force dr, it would be work.", 
    "But it is force per unit charged that makes it E.", 
    "So the potential of B, by definition, is the integral", 
    "from B to infinity of E dot dr. And so, therefore, the", 
    "potential difference between point A and B VA minus VB", 
    "equals the integral from A to B of E dot dr.", 
    "And for reasons that I still don't understand, after having", 
    "been in this business for a long time, books will always", 
    "tell you they reverse VA and VbB So they give you", 
    "VB minus the VA.", 
    "And then they say, well, we have to put a minus sign in", 
    "front of the integral, the same thing.", 
    "So books always give it to you in this form.", 
    "But it is exactly the same.", 
    "Hope you realize that.", 
    "The two equations that I have here are the same.", 
    "VA minus VB is the integral from A to B of E dot dr. If I", 
    "flip this over then all I have to do is put a minus sign", 
    "here, and the two are identical.", 
    "Notice that if there is no electric field between A and", 
    "B, they have the same potential, of course.", 
    "Because when you march from A to B with a charge in your", 
    "pocket, no work is done.", 
    "So the potential remains the same.", 
    "I will change this dr to a different symbol,", 
    "which I call dl.", 
    "dr would mean that we go from A to infinity along this", 
    "straight line.", 
    "And then we go from B to infinity along", 
    "the straight line.", 
    "But it makes no difference how you go.", 
    "If you go from A to B, this potential difference, and", 
    "you're going this way, then VA minus VB is", 
    "not going to change.", 
    "And so, if now I introduce here a element, dl, which is a", 
    "small vector.", 
    "And if the local E vector here is like so, at this point", 
    "here, then VA minus VB is then the integral of E dot dl.", 
    "In other words, I can replace the r by an l.", 
    "And you may choose any path that you prefer.", 
    "And that's the way that we will show you this equation", 
    "most of the time.", 
    "So it makes no difference how you march because we are", 
    "dealing here with conservative fields.", 
    "So let's now make the assumption", 
    "that VA is 150 volts.", 
    "And that VB, for instance, is 50 volts.", 
    "So it is a very specific example.", 
    "What does it mean now?", 
    "It means that if I put plus q charge in my pocket and I come", 
    "all the way from Lobby 7.", 
    "And I walk up to point B. So Walter Lewin plus q charge in", 
    "his pocket, goes from Lobby 7 to point B. I have to do work.", 
    "And the work I have to do is the product of my charge q", 
    "with the potential.", 
    "So that is q, the work I have to do, is q times VB.", 
    "So in this case it's 50 times q, whatever that charge is", 
    "that I have in my pocket.", 
    "This is in joules.", 
    "Now, I go from Lobby 7 to point A. I", 
    "have to do more work.", 
    "I have to do 150q joules of work.", 
    "You can think of it, I first come to", 
    "B, I'm already exhausted.", 
    "I have to put in another work to get all the way to point A.", 
    "So you can imagine if I have this plus q charge at point A,", 
    "what it is, it's a higher potential, it wants to go back", 
    "all by itself to B. It wants to go from a higher potential", 
    "to a lower potential.", 
    "Look, the E vector is in this direction.", 
    "Positive charge will go to a lower potential.", 
    "And as it moves from A to B, energy is released.", 
    "How much energy?", 
    "Well, this is the amount of work I have done to get to A.", 
    "This is the amount of work I did to get to B. And so, if", 
    "now the charge goes back from A to B, it's the difference", 
    "that becomes available in terms of kinetic energy.", 
    "It's a change in potential energy.", 
    "And that change in potential energy--", 
    "So the change in potential energy when the plus q charge", 
    "goes from A to B, that change is q times VA minus VB.", 
    "qVB at point B. And qVA at point A. So this is the", 
    "potential energy that is in principle available if the", 
    "charge moves from A to B.", 
    "And, you remember from 8.01, the work energy theorem.", 
    "If we deal with conservative forces then the sum of", 
    "potential energy and kinetic energy of an", 
    "object is the same.", 
    "That's also true for gravitational forces.", 
    "In other words, this difference in potential energy", 
    "that becomes available, like potential energy becomes", 
    "available when I drop my chalk from a high potential to low", 
    "potential, that's converted to kinetic energy.", 
    "So this difference now is also converted into kinetic energy", 
    "of that moving charge.", 
    "And so that would be the kinetic energy at point B", 
    "minus the kinetic energy at point A, which is really the", 
    "work energy theorem.", 
    "It's the conservation of energy.", 
    "Now any piece of metal, no matter how crummy or dented it", 
    "is, is an equipotential, as long as there is no charge", 
    "moving inside the metal.", 
    "And that's obvious that it's an equipotential.", 
    "Because these charges inside the metal, these electrons,", 
    "when they experience an electric field, they begin to", 
    "move immediately in the electric field.", 
    "And they will move until there is no force on them anymore.", 
    "And that means they have effectively made the electric", 
    "field zero.", 
    "So charges inside a conductor always move automatically in", 
    "such a way that they kill the electric field inside.", 
    "If the electric field hadn't been zero yet, they would", 
    "still be moving.", 
    "And so each metal that you have, no matter where you", 
    "bring it, as long as there are no electric currents inside,", 
    "will always be an equipotential.", 
    "So I can take a trash can and bring it into an external", 
    "field and then very shortly after I've brought it in, when", 
    "things have calmed down, the trash can will be an", 
    "equipotential.", 
    "And the electric field inside the metal will", 
    "everywhere be zero.", 
    "So I could, for instance, attach point A to a trash can,", 
    "metal trash can, so the whole trash can", 
    "would be at 150 volts.", 
    "And I could put point B, make it part of my soda, which is", 
    "also made of metal.", 
    "And so the whole soda would be at 50 volts.", 
    "And the entire trash can would be at 150 volts.", 
    "I place the whole thing in vacuum.", 
    "And now I release an electron at point B. An electron wants", 
    "to go to higher potential.", 
    "A proton would go from A to B. Electron wants to go from B to", 
    "A.", 
    "And so, now energy is available.", 
    "The electric potential energy is available.", 
    "And the electron will start to pick up speed.", 
    "And finally end up at A. Now how it will", 
    "travel, I don't know.", 
    "The electric field configuration is enormously", 
    "complicated between the can and this trash can.", 
    "Amazingly complicated.", 
    "If you were to see the field lines it would be weird.", 
    "But if all we want to know is what the kinetic energy is,", 
    "what the speed is, with which this electron", 
    "reaches the can, so what?", 
    "Then we can use the work energy theorem and find out", 
    "immediately what that kinetic energy is."
