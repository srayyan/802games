    "WALTER LEWIN: But now, if you go very far away from this", 
    "charge configuration--", 
    "anywhere, but very far away, much farther than the distance", 
    "between the two charges, so somewhere here or somewhere", 
    "there or somewhere there or here--", 
    "notice that always the arrows are pointing away.", 
    "And the reason is that +3 and -1 is as good as a +2 if", 
    "you're very, very far away.", 
    "But of course, when you are very close in, then the", 
    "field's configuration can be very, very complicated.", 
    "But you see very clearly that these arrows are", 
    "all pointing outwards.", 
    "None of them come back to the -1.", 
    "None of them point to the -1 direction.", 
    "And that's because the +3 is more powerful.", 
    "And then there is, here, this point and only one point", 
    "whereby the electric field is 0.", 
    "If you put a positive test charge here, the minus will", 
    "attract it.", 
    "The plus will repel it.", 
    "And therefore, there comes a point where the two cancel", 
    "each other exactly.", 
    "Now, there is another way of electric field representation", 
    "which is more organized.", 
    "And we call these field lines.", 
    "So you see again the +3.", 
    "And you see there the -1.", 
    "If I release right here, or I place here a positive test", 
    "charge, all I know is that the force will be tangential to", 
    "the field lines.", 
    "That is the meaning of these lines.", 
    "So if I'm here, the force will be in this direction.", 
    "If I put a positive test charge here, the force will be", 
    "in this direction.", 
    "And of course, if it's a negative charge, the force", 
    "flips over.", 
    "So the meaning of the field lines are that it always tells", 
    "you in which direction a charge experiences a force--", 
    "a positive charge always in the direction of the arrows,", 
    "tangentially to the field lines, and a negative charge", 
    "in the opposite direction.", 
    "How many field lines are there in space?", 
    "Well, of course there are an infinite number, just like", 
    "these little arrows that we had before.", 
    "We only sprinkled in a few.", 
    "But of course, in every single point there", 
    "is an electric field.", 
    "And so you can put in an infinite", 
    "number of field lines.", 
    "And that would make this", 
    "representation, of course, useless.", 
    "So we always limit ourselves to a certain number.", 
    "If you look very close to the -1, notice that all the field", 
    "lines come in on the -1.", 
    "We understand that, of course, because the field lines want", 
    "to go to the -1.", 
    "If you're very close to the plus, then they will go away", 
    "from the plus.", 
    "They're being repelled.", 
    "You can sort of think of these field lines, if you want to", 
    "imagine the configuration, that the plus charges blow out", 
    "air, like a hairdryer, and that the minus suck in air,", 
    "like a vacuum cleaner.", 
    "And then you get a feeling for what is on the left side here,", 
    "this hair dryer which wants to blow out stuff.", 
    "And then there is that little circle that wants to suck", 
    "something in, and it succeeds to some degree.", 
    "It's not as powerful as the +3, though.", 
    "Have we lost all information about field strength?", 
    "Earlier with these arrows, we had the lengths of the arrow.", 
    "The magnitude of the field was represented.", 
    "Yeah, you have lost that.", 
    "But there is still some information on field strength.", 
    "If the lines are closer together, if the density of", 
    "the lines is high, the electric field is stronger", 
    "than when the density becomes low.", 
    "So if you look, for instance, here, look how many lines", 
    "there are per few millimeters.", 
    "And when you go further out, these lines spread out.", 
    "That tells you the E field is going down.", 
    "The strength of the E field is going down.", 
    "It's the 1 over r squared field, of course.", 
    "If you want to make these drawings, what you could do to", 
    "make them look good, you could make three times more field", 
    "lines going out from the plus, in this case, than", 
    "return to the -1.", 
    "So the field lines are very powerful.", 
    "And we will often think in terms of electric fields and", 
    "the line configurations.", 
    "And you will have several homework problems that deal", 
    "with electric fields and with the electric field lines.", 
    "If an electric field line is straight, so I", 
    "have electric fields--", 
    "Get some red chalk.", 
    "Say we have fields that are like this, straight E-field", 
    "lines, and I release a charge there--", 
    "for instance, a positive charge--", 
    "then the positive charge would experience a force exactly in", 
    "the same direction as the field line because the", 
    "tangential now is in the direction of the field line.", 
    "It would become accelerated in this direction.", 
    "It would always stay on the field lines.", 
    "If I release it with 0 speed, start to accelerate, then it", 
    "would stay on the field lines.", 
    "In a similar way, if we think of the Earth as having a", 
    "gravitational field, with 8.01 we may never have used that", 
    "word \"gravitational field.\" But in physics, we think of", 
    "gravity also being a field.", 
    "If I have here a piece of chalk, the field lines, the", 
    "gravitational field lines, room 26-100, nicely parallel", 
    "and straight, and if I release this piece of chalk at 0", 
    "speed, it will begin to move in the direction", 
    "of the field lines.", 
    "And it'll stay on the field lines.", 
    "So now you can ask yourself the question, if I release a", 
    "charge, would it always follow the field lines?", 
    "And the answer is no, only in this very special case.", 
    "But suppose now that the field lines are curved.", 
    "So here are field lines as you see in those configurations.", 
    "It's very common.", 
    "If now I release a charge in here, say I have a point", 
    "charge here, it will experience a", 
    "force in this direction.", 
    "So it will get an acceleration in this direction.", 
    "So it will immediately abandon that field line.", 
    "And so if now you ask me what is the trajectory of that", 
    "charge, well, it could become very complicated.", 
    "I really don't know.", 
    "Maybe it's going like this.", 
    "And by the time it reaches this point, what I do know", 
    "that then the force will be tangential to this field line.", 
    "It will be in this direction.", 
    "And so as it marches out and picks up speed, locally it", 
    "will experience forces representative", 
    "of those field lines.", 
    "And so the trajectory can be rather complicated.", 
    "So field lines are not trajectories, and not even", 
    "when you release a charge with 0 speed, only in case that the", 
    "field lines are straight lines.", 
    "Let's now look at a field configuration--", 
    "which Maxwell himself, the great maestro, in some of his", 
    "publications put there--", 
    "with a ratio 1 to 4.", 
    "And whether it is +4, +1 or -4, -1 is not important,", 
    "because that's just a matter of the", 
    "direction of the arrows.", 
    "But Maxwell didn't put arrows in.", 
    "So I leave it up to you.", 
    "If it's +4 and +1, you have to put arrows going outwards.", 
    "And what you see now, here, is this air-blower effect.", 
    "Think of them as both being positive.", 
    "So there is the +4 trying to blow air", 
    "out, like a hair dryer.", 
    "And the +1 is trying to do its own thing.", 
    "And so you get a field configuration, field lines", 
    "which are not, perhaps, easy.", 
    "But you can imagine why it has this peculiar shape.", 
    "If you put a plus test charge in between the 1 and the 4,", 
    "then the 4 will repel it.", 
    "But the 1 will also repel it.", 
    "And so there is going to be a point somewhere, probably", 
    "close to 1, whereby the two forces exactly cancel out.", 
    "Therefore, E will be 0 there.", 
    "In a similar way, between the moon and the Earth, there is a", 
    "point not too far away from the moon where the", 
    "gravitational attraction from the Earth and the", 
    "gravitational attraction from the moon exactly", 
    "cancel each other out.", 
    "That's not too dissimilar from this situation.", 
    "So when you have charges of the same polarity, you always", 
    "find in between somewhere a point where the", 
    "electric field is 0.", 
    "Let's now go to a very special case whereby I make the two", 
    "charges equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.", 
    "And we have a name for that.", 
    "We call that a dipole.", 
    "The plus charge is here, and the minus charge is there.", 
    "The situation is extremely symmetric, as you would", 
    "expect, because they have equal power.", 
    "There's one air blower upstairs and one vacuum", 
    "cleaner downstairs.", 
    "If you're close to the plus charge, notice that all the", 
    "field lines go away from the plus.", 
    "And if you're close to the minus, notice at all the field", 
    "lines come in on the minus.", 
    "You expect that.", 
    "If you are far away from this dipole,", 
    "now you have a problem.", 
    "Before, we had a +3 and a -1.", 
    "And when you're far way, the +3 wins, so it's", 
    "like having a +2 charge.", 
    "If you're far away, you always expect the electric field,", 
    "then, to be pointing away from the equivalent charge of +2.", 
    "But if you add a plus and minus, and they have equal", 
    "magnitude--", 
    "let's say +1, -1-- you get 0.", 
    "So neither one wins if you're far away.", 
    "And notice carefully, if you're very far away, indeed", 
    "you do not see the arrows either pointing out nor", 
    "pointing in.", 
    "Nature cannot decide.", 
    "There isn't one that is stronger than the other.", 
    "That makes dipole fields very, very special.", 
    "In the case of the +3 and the -1, if you're very far away,", 
    "it's like having a +2 charge.", 
    "And the E field, when you go further and further out, will", 
    "fall off as 1 over r squared.", 
    "With a dipole, your intuition sort of tells you that it will", 
    "probably fall off faster than 1 over r squared.", 
    "And that is part of a homework assignment that", 
    "you have this week.", 
    "In fact, I can already give you the answer.", 
    "You have to prove it.", 
    "If you're far away from an electric dipole, the electric", 
    "field falls off as 1 over r cubed.", 
    "It goes faster than 1 over r squared.", 
    "There's not a single point in space where the", 
    "electric field is 0.", 
    "You could think about that, why that is the case.", 
    "So these field configurations can be rather complicated and", 
    "can be very interesting.", 
    "And each one has its own applications.", 
    "Are dipoles rare in physics?", 
    "Not at all.", 
    "In fact, they are extremely common.", 
    "You cannot avoid them.", 
    "Remember last time I told you if you have a spherical atom,", 
    "or we have a spherical molecule, and you bring that", 
    "close to a charge--", 
    "let's now think of it, you bring it in an electric field.", 
    "That's another way of saying the same thing.", 
    "So we have a nice spherical atom or a nice spherical", 
    "molecule, and we bring it in the electric field.", 
    "The electron wants to go upstream the", 
    "electric field vectors.", 
    "They go against the direction of the electric field.", 
    "And the positive charge wants to go in the direction, wants", 
    "to go downstream.", 
    "And so what are you going to do?", 
    "The electrons will spend a little bit more time on one", 
    "side of the nucleus than they would in the absence of that", 
    "electric field.", 
    "And therefore, you are, through induction, turning", 
    "that atom, turning that molecule,", 
    "in becoming a dipole.", 
    "If you have a little bit more charge on this side averaged", 
    "over time, you have the same amount of extra charge plus on", 
    "that side averaged over time.", 
    "So you make dipoles very often, whether", 
    "you like it or not.", 
    "And later in this course, we will learn more about the", 
    "polarization of atoms and molecules, creating dipoles,", 
    "when we talk about dielectrics.", 
    "And you will see that it can have an enormous impact on the", 
    "properties of the material.", 
    "Could I make you a dipole here in class?", 
    "Oh yeah, that's very easy.", 
    "To make one of nonconductors is not so easy in class.", 
    "To make one of conductors is very easy.", 
    "And I'm going to do that with these two", 
    "spheres that you have.", 
    "Look at these two metal spheres--", 
    "conductors, free electrons.", 
    "So it's very easy for them to move.", 
    "And I'm going to bring this rubber rod, which I will rub", 
    "and becomes, I think, negatively charged, if I", 
    "remember correctly.", 
    "And I will bring that, say, close to these two which are", 
    "touching each other.", 
    "So here is this one metal sphere.", 
    "And here is the other metal sphere.", 
    "And here comes the rubber, negatively charged.", 
    "Ah!", 
    "What's going to happen?", 
    "The electrons want to go away.", 
    "So this becomes negatively charged.", 
    "And therefore, this remains a little bit positively charged.", 
    "For every one electron that is excess here--", 
    "when I start, it's neutral--", 
    "there will be a positive excess there", 
    "because charge is conserved.", 
    "You can't create charge out of nothing.", 
    "And now what I do, while this rubber is still here, while", 
    "that rubber rod is there, I separate them.", 
    "So they are in contact with each other first.", 
    "They have to be in contact.", 
    "Wow, we've got some visitors.", 
    "SPEAKERS 2 AND 3 (TOGETHER): [CLAP, CLAP]", 
    "Don't be late.", 
    "That means you, pretty boy.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: I'm impressed.", 
    "Thank you.", 
    "So what I do now is while this rubber rod is still in place,", 
    "I take them apart.", 
    "And when I take them apart, this negative charge is", 
    "trapped, and this positive charge is trapped.", 
    "And so I have thereby created negative charge on this one,", 
    "positive on this one.", 
    "And it's equal in magnitude, so I have a dipole.", 
    "What I want to demonstrate to you is that, indeed, I have", 
    "positive charged here and negative here.", 
    "There is a difference in polarity between these two.", 
    "And that's the way that I will do the experiment.", 
    "I will not show you that the amount of charge is exactly", 
    "the same on each, which, of course, it has to be.", 
    "So let me give you some better light.", 
    "We have to get the viewgraph off, the overhead.", 
    "You see there for the first time an electroscope.", 
    "We discussed it last time.", 
    "It is a piece of aluminum foil, very thin, with a metal", 
    "rod next to it.", 
    "And when I put charge on the rod, it will also go into the", 
    "aluminum foil.", 
    "And they will repel each other.", 
    "And so the aluminum tinsel will go to the right.", 
    "And the more charge there is on it, the farther", 
    "it goes to the right.", 
    "So let me first put these two together, make sure they are", 
    "completely discharged.", 
    "And now I'm going to bring these two into an electric", 
    "field, which is produced by this rubber rod.", 
    "I have to rub with the cat fur.", 
    "And I believe it was negative.", 
    "But you'd never have to remember whether it is", 
    "negative or positive, of course.", 
    "That is not so important.", 
    "What is in a name, after all?", 
    "But it happens to be negative.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So now we go here.", 
    "I bring it here.", 
    "I hope that no sparks will fly over, because that ruins the", 
    "demonstration.", 
    "And now notice what I do.", 
    "While the rod is here, I separate them.", 
    "So as I was holding it there, things were going on in there", 
    "that you and I couldn't see, with the electrons.", 
    "The rubber rod is negative.", 
    "The electrons were shifting in this direction.", 
    "And this is now positive, and that is now negative.", 
    "If I take this one, and I touch it with the", 
    "electroscope, you clearly see that there is charge on this.", 
    "How can I show you now that there is charge of different", 
    "polarity on the other one?", 
    "Well, the way I will do that is I will approach this", 
    "electroscope by bringing this sphere very close to it.", 
    "And if this charge is different, then the charge", 
    "that is on it, the electroscope reading, will", 
    "become smaller.", 
    "And why is that?", 
    "Why will the reading becomes smaller?", 
    "Well, here is the situation of the electroscope now.", 
    "And here is that ball that you see on top.", 
    "It is upside down there.", 
    "If this is all negative--", 
    "that's why it is apart--", 
    "if now I approach this here with an object which is", 
    "positively charged--", 
    "and I claim that this one now is positively charged, because", 
    "this one was negatively charged--", 
    "the electrons love the positive charge.", 
    "So the electrons want to come to the positive charge.", 
    "So these electrons drift down again.", 
    "And so if they come down, fewer will be here.", 
    "And so you will see this.", 
    "If, however, I put here a negative rod, then the", 
    "electrons which are here want to go further away.", 
    "They will stream up.", 
    "And therefore, the reading will become larger.", 
    "So you can always, through induction, test what the", 
    "polarity is of your charge.", 
    "Let's hope that this one is still holding its charge while", 
    "I was talking.", 
    "So I claim now that if this polarity is different, and if", 
    "it's still there when I approach the electroscope,", 
    "come very close, that the reading should become a little", 
    "smaller, without even touching it.", 
    "Let's see whether that works.", 
    "You see it goes down.", 
    "You see it goes down.", 
    "It goes down.", 
    "So through induction, I have demonstrated that this has,", 
    "indeed, a different polarity from this one.", 
    "If I approach it with this one, it would go further out", 
    "unless it already is at a maximum.", 
    "Let's try that.", 
    "You see it goes further out.", 
    "So not only have I demonstrated that I created", 
    "the dipole, but you've also seen that by means of", 
    "induction, you can demonstrate that there is a difference in", 
    "polarity between the two spheres.", 
    "If I create a dipole, and I put that dipole in an electric", 
    "field, the dipole will start to rotate."
