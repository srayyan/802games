    "WALTER LEWIN: And so now what I want to do is to show you", 
    "the remarkable consequences of the presence of a", 
    "self-inductor in a circuit.", 
    "And I start very simple.", 
    "I have here a battery, which has EMF V. I have here a", 
    "switch, and here I have a self inductor--", 
    "we always draw a self-inductor in a circuit with these coils.", 
    "And we also have in series a resistor, which we always", 
    "indicate with these teeth.", 
    "And I close this switch when there is no current running.", 
    "In other words, at time t equals zero when I close this", 
    "switch, there is no current.", 
    "When I close the switch, the current wants to increase.", 
    "But the self-inductance says uh-uh, take it easy.", 
    "Lenz's law.", 
    "I don't like the change of such a current.", 
    "So the self-inductance is fighting the current that", 
    "wants to go through it.", 
    "But there comes a time that the self-inductance loses the", 
    "fight, if you wait long enough.", 
    "And then, of course, the current has reached a maximum", 
    "value, which you can find with Ohm's Law.", 
    "Because the self-inductance itself has no resistor.", 
    "Think of the self-inductance as made of", 
    "superconducting material.", 
    "There's no resistance.", 
    "And so without knowing much about physics, you can make a", 
    "plot about the current that is going to flow as", 
    "a function of time.", 
    "You start out with zero.", 
    "And then ultimately, if you wait long enough, you reach a", 
    "maximum current, which is given by Ohm's Law, which is", 
    "simply V divided by R. And you slowly approach that value.", 
    "And how slowly depends on the value of the self-inductance.", 
    "If the self-inductance is very high, it might", 
    "climb up like this.", 
    "This is a high value for L. If the self-inductance is very", 
    "low, then it's a low value for L.", 
    "If the self-inductance were zero, it would come up", 
    "instantaneously.", 
    "But I just convinced you that there is no such thing as zero", 
    "self-inductance.", 
    "There's always something finite, no matter how small.", 
    "And so this is qualitatively what you would expect if you", 
    "use your stomach, and if you don't use your brains yet.", 
    "There's nothing wrong with using your stomach", 
    "occasionally.", 
    "But now I want to do this in a more civilized way.", 
    "And I want to use my brains.", 
    "And when I use my brains, I have to set up an equation for", 
    "this circuit.", 
    "And if you read your book, you will find that Mr. Giancoli", 
    "tells you to use Kirchhoff's loop rule.", 
    "But Mr. Giancoli doesn't understand Faraday's Law.", 
    "And he's not the only one.", 
    "Almost every college book that you read on", 
    "physics do this wrong.", 
    "They advise you to use Kirchhoff's loop rule, which", 
    "says that the closed loop integral around", 
    "the circuit is zero.", 
    "That, of course, is utter nonsense.", 
    "How can it be zero?", 
    "Because there is a change in magnetic flux.", 
    "And so it can only be minus d phi/dt.", 
    "I advise you to go to the 8.02 website and download the", 
    "lecture supplement that you'll find, in which I address this", 
    "issue, and hit it very hard.", 
    "So the closed loop integral of E dot dl, if you go around", 
    "this circuit, is not zero.", 
    "It's minus d phi/dt, Faraday's Law, so it's minus L dI/dt.", 
    "So we have to go around the circuit, and we have to apply", 
    "Faraday's Law, and not Kirchhoff's loop rule, which", 
    "doesn't apply here.", 
    "This is the plus side of the battery, and this", 
    "is the minus side.", 
    "So the electric field in the battery is in this direction.", 
    "The electric field in the self-inductance is zero,", 
    "because the self-inductance has no resistance.", 
    "It's superconducting material.", 
    "And so the electric field in the resistor--", 
    "if the current is in this direction, which it will be--", 
    "then the electric field in the resistor", 
    "will be in this direction.", 
    "So now I am equipped to write down the closed loop integral", 
    "of E dot dl.", 
    "I start here.", 
    "And I always go in the direction of the current, and", 
    "I advise you to do the same.", 
    "I don't care that you guess the wrong", 
    "direction for the current.", 
    "That's fine.", 
    "Later minus signs will correct that.", 
    "They will tell you that you really", 
    "guessed the wrong direction.", 
    "But always go around the loop in the direction of the", 
    "current, because then the EMF is always minus L dI/dt.", 
    "If you go in the direction opposed to the current, then", 
    "it is plus L dI/dt, and that could become confusing.", 
    "So I always go in the direction of the current.", 
    "And so I first go through the self-inductance.", 
    "There is no electric field in the self-inductance.", 
    "So the integral E dot dl going from here to here is zero.", 
    "This is where the books are wrong.", 
    "It is zero.", 
    "Now I go through the resistor.", 
    "And so now I get plus I R. E and dl", 
    "are in the same direction.", 
    "Ohm's Law tells me it's I R.", 
    "In the battery, I go against the electric fields.", 
    "And so I get minus V. That now equals minus L dI/dt.", 
    "And this is the only sane and the only correct way to apply", 
    "Faraday's Law in this circuit.", 
    "You could write it a little differently, which may give", 
    "you some insight.", 
    "For instance, you could write that I can bring V and dl and", 
    "L to one side.", 
    "So I can write down that V minus L dI/dt equals I R. It's", 
    "the same equation when you look.", 
    "And the nice thing about writing it this way is that", 
    "since the dI/dt is positive here, it's growing in time,", 
    "the induced EMF, which is this value--", 
    "notice it's always opposing the voltage of my battery, and", 
    "that's what Lenz's Law is all about.", 
    "It's not until dI/dt has become zero that V equals I R.", 
    "And that happens, of course, if you wait long enough.", 
    "And so we have to solve that differential equation.", 
    "And what is often done, that you bring all the terms to the", 
    "left side, and that you get a zero on the right side.", 
    "And so what you often see is that L dI/dt plus I R minus V", 
    "equals zero.", 
    "And because we have zero here, some physicist thinks that", 
    "this is an application of Kirchhoff's", 
    "rule, which is nonsense.", 
    "You can always make a zero here by bringing all the terms", 
    "to this side.", 
    "The closed loop integral of E dot dl is not zero.", 
    "The closed loop integral of E dot dl is minus L dI/dt.", 
    "But when I shift minus L dI/dt to this side, I get zero here.", 
    "And of course the people who write these books know that", 
    "this is the right answer.", 
    "And so they manipulate it so they get this equation, and", 
    "they call that Kirchhoff's rule.", 
    "Sad, and also embarrassing.", 
    "So this is the equation that you have to solve.", 
    "Some of you may have solved this equation in 8.01 already.", 
    "Surely you didn't have an I here.", 
    "You may have had an x here for the position.", 
    "But you probably solved it where you had friction.", 
    "Maybe you didn't.", 
    "I'll give you the solution to that differential equation.", 
    "It's a very easy solution.", 
    "The current as a function of time is a maximum value times", 
    "1 minus e to the minus R divided by L times t.", 
    "And I max, that is the maximum current, is V divided by R.", 
    "Let's look at this in a little bit more detail.", 
    "First notice that when t equals zero, that indeed, you", 
    "find I equals zero.", 
    "Substituting in t equals zero, you get 1 minus 1.", 
    "So you find indeed that I equals zero.", 
    "Substitute in there t goes to infinity.", 
    "Then you find that I indeed becomes V divided by R, which", 
    "is exactly what you expect.", 
    "If t becomes infinity, then clearly the self-inductance", 
    "has lost all its power, so to speak, and the current is", 
    "simply V divided by R. It's the maximum current", 
    "that you can have.", 
    "So that's a must.", 
    "That's a requirement.", 
    "If you wait L over R seconds--", 
    "and believe it or not, if you have some time, convince", 
    "yourself that L over R indeed as a unit is seconds--", 
    "then the current, I is about 63 percent of I max.", 
    "Because if t is L over R, then you get 1 minus", 
    "1 divided by e.",
