    "WALTER LEWIN: What now is going to happen?", 
    "Well, for sure V is unchanged because it's connected with", 
    "the power supply.", 
    "So that cannot change.", 
    "What happens with Q free?", 
    "Look at this equation.", 
    "When I put in the dielectric, I know that the capacitance", 
    "goes up by a factor of kappa.", 
    "C will go up by a factor of kappa.", 
    "If C goes up with a factor of kappa and if V is not", 
    "changing, then Q free must go up by a factor of kappa.", 
    "Follows immediately from equation three.", 
    "So this must go up by a factor of kappa.", 
    "Well, does that mean that the charge will", 
    "flow through the plates?", 
    "I increase the charge on the plates.", 
    "And so my amp meter will tell me that.", 
    "And so my amp meter will say aha.", 
    "I have to put charge on the plates and so my amp meter", 
    "will now do this.", 
    "And that's what I want to show you.", 
    "The remarkable thing now is that the electric field E, the", 
    "net electric field E, will not change.", 
    "And you may say, but you put in the dielectric.", 
    "Yeah, I put in the dielectric, but I kept the potential", 
    "difference constant, and I kept the d constant.", 
    "And since V is always E times d, if I keep this at 1,500", 
    "volts, and I keep the 7 millimeters 7 millimeters,", 
    "then the net electric field cannot change.", 
    "It's exactly what it was before.", 
    "That is the reason why Q free has to change.", 
    "Think about that.", 
    "Because you do introduce induced charges on the", 
    "dielectric, and you have to compensate for that to keep", 
    "the E field constant.", 
    "And the only way that nature can compensate for that is to", 
    "increase the charge on the plates, the free charge.", 
    "And so that's what I want to show you now,", 
    "which is the last part.", 
    "So I'm going now to put in the dielectric and what you will", 
    "see then is that current will flow onto the plates, so the", 
    "propeller will do nothing.", 
    "It will sit there.", 
    "And you will see this one go clunk when I", 
    "bring in the glass.", 
    "And then it goes back, of course.", 
    "It is only a little charge that comes off and then it", 
    "will go back.", 
    "As I plunge it in, you will see charge", 
    "flowing onto the plates.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "You ready for it?", 
    "3, 2, 1, 0.", 
    "And you saw it, charge flowing on through the plates.", 
    "When I remove the glass, of course, then the charge goes", 
    "off the plates again.", 
    "And you see that now.", 
    "I've shown you four demonstrations.", 
    "None of this is intuitive.", 
    "Not for you and not for me.", 
    "Whenever I do these things, I have to, very carefully, sit", 
    "down and think what actually is changing", 
    "and what is not changing.", 
    "I have no gut feeling for that.", 
    "There is not something in me says, oh yes, of course that's", 
    "going to happen.", 
    "Not at all.", 
    "And I don't expect that from you either.", 
    "The only advice I have for you, when you're dealing with", 
    "these cases whereby dielectric goes in, dielectric goes out,", 
    "plates separate, plates not separate, power supply", 
    "connected, power supply not connected, approach it in a", 
    "very cold-blooded way, the real classic MIT way, very", 
    "cold blooded.", 
    "Think about what is not changing and then pick it up", 
    "from there and see what the consequences would be.", 
    "How can I build a very large capacitor, one that has a very", 
    "large capacitance?", 
    "Well, capacitance C is the area times epsilon zero", 
    "divided by d times kappa, which your book calls k.", 
    "So make k large, make A large, and make d as small as you", 
    "possibly can.", 
    "But you have a limit for d.", 
    "If you make d too small, you may get sparks between the", 
    "conductors because you may exceed the electric field, the", 
    "breakdown electric field.", 
    "So you must always stay below that breakdown field, which in", 
    "air would be 3 million volts per meter.", 
    "If you want a very large kappa, you would say, well,", 
    "why don't you make the layer water in between?", 
    "That has a kappa of 80.", 
    "The problem is that water has a very low breakdown electric", 
    "field, so you don't want water.", 
    "If you take polyethylene--", 
    "I just call it poly here, just as an abbreviation--", 
    "polyethylene has a breakdown electric field of 18 million", 
    "volts per meter, and it has a kappa, I believe, of 3.", 
    "Many capacitors are made whereby the layer in between", 
    "is polyethylene.", 
    "Although, mica would be really superior.", 
    "Be it as it may, I want to evaluate now with you two", 
    "capacitors, which each have the same capacitance of 100", 
    "microfarad.", 
    "But one of them, the manufacturer says that you", 
    "could put a maximum potential difference of", 
    "4,000 volts over it.", 
    "That's this baby.", 
    "And the other, I go to Radio Shack, and it says you cannot", 
    "exceed the potential difference not", 
    "more than 40 volts.", 
    "Well, if I have polyethylene in between the layers of the", 
    "conductors, then I can calculate what this thickness,", 
    "d, should be before I get breakdown.", 
    "That's very easy because V equals E d.", 
    "And so I put in here 18 million volts per meter, and I", 
    "go to 4,000 volts.", 
    "And then I see what I have for d.", 
    "And it turns out that the minimum value for d, you", 
    "cannot go any thinner, is then 220 microns.", 
    "And so for this one it is only 2.2 microns.", 
    "You can make it much thinner because the potential", 
    "difference is 100 times lower, so we can make the layer 100", 
    "times thinner before you get electric breakdown.", 
    "I want the two capacitors to have the same capacitance.", 
    "That means, since they have the same kappa and they have", 
    "the same epsilon0, it means that A over d has to be the", 
    "same for both capacitors.", 
    "So A divided by d for this one must be the same as A divided", 
    "by d for that one.", 
    "But if d here is 100 times larger than this one, then", 
    "this A must also be 100 times larger", 
    "because A over d is constant.", 
    "So if A here is 100, then A is here 1.", 
    "But now think about it.", 
    "What determines the volume of a capacitor?", 
    "That's really the area of the plates times the thickness.", 
    "And if I ignore for now the thickness of the conducting", 
    "plates, then the volume of a capacitor clearly is the", 
    "product between the area and the thickness.", 
    "And so, it tells me then that this capacitor, which has 100", 
    "times larger area, is 100 times thicker, will have a", 
    "10,000 times larger volume than this capacitor.", 
    "And this baby is 4,000 volts, 100 microfarads.", 
    "It has a length of about 30 centimeters, 10 centimeters", 
    "like this, 20 centimeters high.", 
    "That is about 10,000 cubic centimeters.", 
    "10,000 cubic centimeters.", 
    "You go to Radio Shack, and you buy yourself a 40-volt", 
    "capacitor, 100 microfarad, which will be 10,000 times", 
    "smaller in volume.", 
    "That will be only 1 cubic centimeter.", 
    "And if I had one of them behind my ear, you wouldn't", 
    "even notice that, would you?", 
    "Could you tell me what it says here?", 
    "100--", 
    "SPEAKER 1: --micro.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Microfarad.", 
    "How many volts?", 
    "SPEAKER 1: 40.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: 40 volts.", 
    "That small.", 
    "Compared to this one which can handle 4,000 volts, but the", 
    "capacitance is the same.", 
    "So you see now the connection with area and with thickness", 
    "is by no means trivial."
