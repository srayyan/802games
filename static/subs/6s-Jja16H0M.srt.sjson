    "WALTER LEWIN: The steady state solution, that is not when you", 
    "turn the thing on.", 
    "But if you wait a while, you get a steady state solution", 
    "for the current.", 
    "And the current that is going to flow now is V 0 divided by", 
    "the square root of R squared plus omega L minus 1 over", 
    "omega C squared times the cosine of omega t minus phi.", 
    "And the tangent of phi is omega L minus 1 over omega C", 
    "divided by R.", 
    "We call this the reactance, the upstairs, for which we", 
    "give often the symbol X. And so this is also X then divided", 
    "by R. And this whole square root that we have here, we", 
    "call that the impedance.", 
    "The units are ohms.", 
    "And we call that Z.", 
    "And so the maximum current that you can have-- the", 
    "current is, of course, oscillating with angular", 
    "frequency omega--", 
    "the maximum value that you can have for the current, which I", 
    "call I max, is then V 0 divided by Z. Then the cosine", 
    "term is either plus or minus 1.", 
    "I can plot now this I max as a function of frequency.", 
    "So here is frequency.", 
    "And here is I max.", 
    "If the frequency is very low, near zero, then this term here", 
    "becomes infinitely high.", 
    "The impedance is infinitely high.", 
    "And so the current is zero.", 
    "I max is zero.", 
    "There's no current flowing at all.", 
    "When we go to very high frequencies, it is the omega L", 
    "term that goes to infinity.", 
    "And so, again, Z goes to infinity.", 
    "So again, I max goes to zero.", 
    "And for other values of omega, you get an I max", 
    "which is not zero.", 
    "And so you get a curve like this, which has the name of", 
    "resonance curve.", 
    "This I max reaches a maximum value when the", 
    "system is at resonance.", 
    "That's what we call resonance.", 
    "And that's the case, clearly, when the reactance is 0,", 
    "because, when the reactance is 0, this part vanishes.", 
    "And if the reactance is not 0, then the maximum current can", 
    "only be lower, can never be higher.", 
    "And so, when X equals 0, you will find that omega L is 1", 
    "divided by omega C. And so the frequency", 
    "for which that happens--", 
    "I call that omega 0, reminds me that it is the resonance--", 
    "is 1 divided by the square root of L C.", 
    "When I am in resonance, phi becomes 0.", 
    "So there is no phase delay between current and the", 
    "driving voltage.", 
    "They are in phase with each other.", 
    "And the value for I max now simply becomes V 0 divided by", 
    "R, because the impedance itself becomes R.", 
    "Very boring.", 
    "Very simple.", 
    "You're looking here at Ohm's Law.", 
    "When the system is in resonance, forget the", 
    "self-inductance.", 
    "Forget the capacitor.", 
    "They are not there.", 
    "They annihilate each other.", 
    "And so the system behaves as if there were only a resistor.", 
    "And that's exactly what you see here.", 
    "I have here some numbers, which you have seen before", 
    "during my lectures.", 
    "You can download this from the web, but you have to go back", 
    "to the lecture when I discuss that.", 
    "And you see here some numbers for R, L and C", 
    "and also for V 0.", 
    "And I calculate for you here the resonant frequency.", 
    "I calculate the frequency also in terms of kiloHertz.", 
    "And here you see the impedance.", 
    "And you see the reactance.", 
    "If I'm 10% below resonance, notice that the 1 over omega C", 
    "term is always larger than omega L. So your reactance, in", 
    "this case, becomes minus 86 ohms.", 
    "The minus sign has, of course, no consequence for the", 
    "current, because you have an X squared here.", 
    "But notice that Z is now almost exclusively determined", 
    "by X and not by R any more, because the 10 ohms of the R", 
    "here play almost no role in comparison with the 86.", 
    "Z becomes 87.", 
    "And the maximum current is 1/10 of an ampere.", 
    "When you're on resonance--", 
    "and that is characteristic for on resonance--", 
    "the two, omega L and 1 over omega C, eat each other up.", 
    "They annihilate each other.", 
    "And so the reactance become 0.", 
    "So Z now is just pure R. X is 0.", 
    "And so the maximum current, in this case, is 1, because I", 
    "chose V 0, 10 and I chose R, 10.", 
    "And then, when I'm 10% above resonance, then the omega L", 
    "term is larger than the reactance of the capacitor.", 
    "And accordingly, you get a lower current again, about 1/8", 
    "of an ampere.", 
    "And so you see this curve being formed in a", 
    "very natural way.", 
    "And that's quantitative.", 
    "You see there some numbers.", 
    "So now comes the question which, of course, in practice", 
    "is very important.", 
    "And that has to do with the power that is generated by the", 
    "power supply.", 
    "That power comes out in the form of heat in the resistor.", 
    "And so, if you time-average the power, then the", 
    "time-average value, you could take the voltage for the power", 
    "supply, multiply that by the current.", 
    "You could also take the time-average value of I", 
    "squared R, because all that energy will ultimately come", 
    "out in the form of heat of the resistor.", 
    "Either one will be fine.", 
    "I've decided to take this one.", 
    "So I will get then V 0 cosine omega t.", 
    "The I becomes V 0 divided by Z times the cosine", 
    "omega t minus phi.", 
    "This is the power at any moment in time.", 
    "I will do the time-averaging a little later.", 
    "When I see cosine omega t minus phi, that reminds me of", 
    "my high school days, cosine alpha minus cosine--", 
    "no, cosine alpha minus beta is cosine alpha cosine beta plus", 
    "sine alpha sine beta.", 
    "That was drilled into my memory here.", 
    "I will never forget that, I think.", 
    "And so I will write down here--", 
    "my math teacher will be proud of me--", 
    "cosine omega t cosine phi plus sine omega t sine phi.", 
    "So this is this term.", 
    "If I'm going to time-average it, I have a cosine omega t", 
    "multiplied by a sine omega t.", 
    "That time-average is zero.", 
    "So this term vanishes.", 
    "So the time-average value of the", 
    "power, I get a V 0 squared.", 
    "I get a Z here.", 
    "And now we have here cosine omega t times cosine omega t.", 
    "The time-average value of cosine squared omega t is 1/2,", 
    "so I get a 2 here.", 
    "And then I still have my cosine phi there.", 
    "And I'm done.", 
    "If you'd like to get rid of this cosine phi, you can do", 
    "that because, remember, the way that phi is defined, the", 
    "tangent of phi is the reactance divided by R. You", 
    "still see it there.", 
    "So that means, if this angle is 90 degrees, that this side", 
    "must be Z. That's the square root of X", 
    "squared plus R squared.", 
    "That's this part.", 
    "And so the cosine of phi is also R divided by Z. And so,", 
    "if you prefer that, there's no particular advantage.", 
    "But if you prefer that, you can write down for cosine phi", 
    "R divided by Z.", 
    "And so you get V 0 squared times R divided by 2.", 
    "And now you get Z squared.", 
    "And so there, you see the power, time-average power, in", 
    "an RLC circuit.", 
    "So now we can look at resonance.", 
    "It's always a very special situation.", 
    "When we are at resonance, Z equals R. So you replace this", 
    "capital Z by R. And then you find V 0", 
    "squared divided by 2R.", 
    "That's utterly trivial.", 
    "You could have predicted that.", 
    "It's really Ohm's Law staring you in the face.", 
    "There is no self-inductance and there is no", 
    "capacitor at resonance.", 
    "So you might as well have treated it as a simple system,", 
    "only with R. And you find immediately then that answer.", 
    "At any other frequency than omega 0, Z would always be", 
    "larger than R. You see that immediately here.", 
    "And so that means that the average power", 
    "would always be lower.", 
    "So it's only at resonance that you generate the", 
    "highest power possible.", 
    "All right, let's go back to our subject", 
    "and see what's next.", 
    "We did LRC circuits.", 
    "Oh yes, we're getting now to traveling waves", 
    "and standing waves.", 
    "Let's start with a traveling wave in a string.", 
    "It's always very nice to do that, because the parallel", 
    "with electromagnetic waves is nearly 100%.", 
    "I have a string that oscillates in the y direction.", 
    "And let's say it propagates in the x direction.", 
    "y 0 cosine k x minus omega t.", 
    "When I see this travelling wave, so the traveling wave is", 
    "in the y direction.", 
    "And it propagates in the x direction.", 
    "I see immediately that it goes into the +x direction, because", 
    "I have a minus sign here that tells me in the +x direction.", 
    "k gives me all the information on the wavelength.", 
    "It's 2 pi divided by lambda.", 
    "Omega equals 2 pi times f, f being the frequency in Hertz,", 
    "would also be 2 pi divided by capital T, capital T now being", 
    "the period of one complete oscillation.", 
    "The speed of propagation, the disturbance propagates in the", 
    "x direction, is omega divided by k.", 
    "And so, if I draw here, at a particular moment in time this", 
    "string, and this would be y 0.", 
    "That would also be y 0.", 
    "And it would propagate in this direction with that velocity.", 
    "And this would be the wavelength, lambda.", 
    "And that lambda is v times T. It's immediately obvious, if", 
    "something propagates with a speed v and it has T seconds", 
    "to go for one oscillation, it moves over a distance lambda.", 
    "That's 8.01.", 
    "Do not confuse this speed of propagation with which the", 
    "disturbance moves with the actual speed of the atoms, of", 
    "the particles in the string.", 
    "If you were a particle in the string and you were sitting", 
    "here, you never move in this direction.", 
    "Your motion is only in the y direction.", 
    "You go from here to there.", 
    "And you oscillate back and forth with that angular", 
    "frequency omega.", 
    "And so, if you're really interested in the speed with", 
    "which you are moving up and down, that of course, that", 
    "speed which we call the transverse speed, is dy/dt.", 
    "And you have to do that then for a particular location, x,", 
    "which you can choose wherever you want", 
    "to sit on that string.", 
    "And I think we had a problem once where we asked you in the", 
    "homework what the transverse speed was.", 
    "So if now move to electromagnetic waves, then", 
    "very little changes.", 
    "Take an electromagnetic wave, a plane wave where the", 
    "E-vector is in the y direction, so E is E 0.", 
    "There's a unit vector in the y direction, cosine k", 
    "x minus omega t.", 
    "This could be a sine, of course.", 
    "There is nothing special in life with the cosine.", 
    "I come to the same conclusion, the wave is travelling in the", 
    "plus x direction.", 
    "And the velocity, the speed of propagation, is", 
    "omega divided by k.", 
    "And if this is vacuum, which I assume for now,", 
    "then that is c.", 
    "And as we have seen from Maxwell's equations, c is 1", 
    "divided by the square root of epsilon 0 mu 0.", 
    "Surprising as that is, that comes out", 
    "of Maxwell's equations.", 
    "And so, if now you were asked, which would be a natural thing", 
    "for me to ask you, what is the associated magnetic field?"
