    "WALTER LEWIN: All right.", 
    "So let this radius be little r.", 
    "Combining 8.02 with 8.01, we now have that m v squared over", 
    "r, m being the mass of the electron, is that force.", 
    "And since v is perpendicular to B, the sine of the angle", 
    "between them is 1, and so I simply get here q v B. This is", 
    "the magnitude of force.", 
    "We already know the direction.", 
    "And so one v goes, and so I get that the radius of that", 
    "circle is m v divided by q B. This being the", 
    "momentum of the electron.", 
    "So v is the velocity of the electron, speed.", 
    "q is the charge.", 
    "B is the magnetic field.", 
    "m is the mass of the electron.", 
    "And as long as this velocity is reasonably smaller than the", 
    "speed of light, we don't have to make a relativistic", 
    "correction here.", 
    "If it's not much smaller than the speed of light, we have to", 
    "make a relativistic correction.", 
    "I discussed the relativistic correction in my lectures, but", 
    "I also mentioned that that would not be part of exams, so", 
    "I will not further elaborate on that.", 
    "So we will just assume that this is completely", 
    "non-relativistic.", 
    "The time for this electron to go around, capital T is 2 pi r", 
    "divided by v. But I know r, so I get 2 pi times m v divided", 
    "by q B. And then I have this v, and I lose this v. And that", 
    "is not so intuitive, but you see that the time is", 
    "independent of the velocity of the electron, assuming that", 
    "it's non-relativistic.", 
    "And we discussed that in the framework of cyclotrons--", 
    "time for these particles to go around", 
    "independent of the velocity.", 
    "Suppose I have a magnetic field B which is 7.8 times 10", 
    "to the -4 Tesla.", 
    "Now, I know what you're thinking.", 
    "You're thinking, why the hell do you take this crazy value?", 
    "There's a reason for that, because I have a", 
    "demonstration here.", 
    "And the magnetic field is 7.8 times 10 to the -4 Tesla.", 
    "If that is the field, I can calculate how long it takes to", 
    "go around, because I know the mass of the electron.", 
    "I know the charge of the electron.", 
    "I know the magnetic field, so in that case T is about 46", 
    "nanoseconds.", 
    "And so the number of times that it goes around, f, which", 
    "is the frequency in Hertz, is 1 over the period--", 
    "is about 22 megahertz.", 
    "So it goes around this electron 22", 
    "million times per second.", 
    "The demonstration that I will show you--", 
    "we have a glass container, spherical.", 
    "It's about yea big.", 
    "You can see it there.", 
    "There's low pressure gas in there, so that some of the", 
    "electrons can go around in a circle before", 
    "they ionize the gas.", 
    "We will accelerate the electrons over a potential", 
    "difference, which I can vary from 0 to 300 volts.", 
    "And so I can give them a certain velocity.", 
    "Suppose I gave them the potential", 
    "difference of 100 volts.", 
    "Then q times delta v, which is the potential difference,", 
    "would then be 1/2 m v squared.", 
    "And so if I make this 100 volts, I can calculate what v", 
    "is, and I found that the velocity of the electrons then", 
    "is about 5.9 times 10 to the 6 meters per second.", 
    "So that's the velocity if I have a potential", 
    "difference of 100 volts.", 
    "And so I can use that velocity, substitute that in", 
    "this equation, and then I get the radius of these electrons", 
    "in that magnetic field.", 
    "And then the radius turns out then to be about 4.3", 
    "centimeters.", 
    "How can I create a uniform magnetic", 
    "field of that magnitude?", 
    "It's indeed perpendicular to the orbit of the electrons.", 
    "We do that using Helmholtz coils.", 
    "We never discussed that in detail during our lecture.", 
    "You see here coils, and you see here coils.", 
    "And when you have two sets of coils like that, and you have", 
    "a proper distance between them, you can create between", 
    "them a magnetic field which is almost constant.", 
    "In this case, this is the field--", 
    "15 times larger than the Earth's magnetic field.", 
    "Perhaps some of you remember that I linked you on the 8.02", 
    "website a few weeks ago to a very nice program that I", 
    "received from Professor Belcher, which allowed you to", 
    "calculate magnetic field configurations", 
    "with current loops.", 
    "And one of the things I asked you on the website is, try to", 
    "create what we call a magnetic bubble.", 
    "This is a magnetic bubble.", 
    "It's also referred to as Helmholtz coils, whereby you", 
    "can create between two coils a uniform magnetic field.", 
    "And so that's what we have here.", 
    "And I'm going to show you now how beautiful these electrons", 
    "go around in circles.", 
    "They ionize the gas inside and then through deexcitation of", 
    "the ionization, you will see light.", 
    "Just the same idea did you see from aurora.", 
    "So in that sense, you're seeing an artificial aurora", 
    "inside a glass tube.", 
    "I have to make it very dark for this, because the light is", 
    "not very bright.", 
    "So we have to turn this off.", 
    "And I have to turn all this off.", 
    "And I have to turn this off.", 
    "And some of you are close can actually see the light", 
    "immediately in the sphere right here in front of me.", 
    "But if not, then you will see it there on the screen.", 
    "So this is the electron gun here.", 
    "It is a potential difference which I set", 
    "roughly at 100 volts.", 
    "And here you see these electrons going around, and", 
    "they go around roughly 22 million times per second.", 
    "And the gas pressure is low, so that some of them make it", 
    "all the way before they ionize the gas.", 
    "And I can change the delta v. I now make the speed lower by", 
    "making the potential difference over which I", 
    "accelerate the electrons--", 
    "by making that lower.", 
    "The radius is proportional to the square root of that", 
    "potential difference.", 
    "And so now you see here, when I increase the potential", 
    "difference, the radius goes up.", 
    "See how beautiful that circle is?", 
    "It's absolutely amazing.", 
    "Very, very nice demonstration.", 
    "And then we reach the edge of the-- we are now very close to", 
    "the diameter of the glass sphere, so we", 
    "can't go much further.", 
    "So now I want to discuss with you Faraday's law.", 
    "Faraday's law comes in many different ways.", 
    "Faraday's law--", 
    "I'll get the Maxwell's equations up again.", 
    "Faraday's law tells you that the induced", 
    "EMF is minus d phi/dt.", 
    "d phi/dt is the magnetic flux change through an open surface", 
    "attached to a loop.", 
    "The loop could be somewhere in your brain or it", 
    "could be a real loop.", 
    "You could imagine any loop in space.", 
    "That is always correct, that statement.", 
    "So the EMF induced equals minus d phi/dt--", 
    "minus d/dt of the integral of B dot dA, open surface.", 
    "You can think of many ways of changing the magnetic flux.", 
    "One way is a stationary loop and having a", 
    "changing magnetic field.", 
    "Another way is of having B constant but changing the", 
    "geometry so that the magnetic flux is", 
    "changing through the surface.", 
    "You rotated it around or you move things around.", 
    "Let's look at both today.", 
    "Let's first take a stationary loop.", 
    "I spent a major part of one lecture on that.", 
    "Say this is a conducting wire and it has a resistance,", 
    "capital R--", 
    "just a natural resistance of the entire wire.", 
    "And suppose here I have a changing magnetic field, and", 
    "this area right here is A. And the magnetic field, let's say,", 
    "is perpendicular to the blackboard.", 
    "And if the strength of the field is B, and so the", 
    "magnetic flux, phi of B, is then simply A times B. And so", 
    "d phi/dt is then A times dB/dt.", 
    "Remember we were going to keep the geometry constant.", 
    "It's a stationary system.", 
    "But we're going to change the magnetic field, so this", 
    "magnetic field is changing.", 
    "Perhaps it's coming out of the blackboard now.", 
    "And maybe it's increasing.", 
    "And so you induce, then, in this conducting wire an EMF."
