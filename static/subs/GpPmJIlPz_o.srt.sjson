    "WALTER LEWIN: And if the distance is 1,000 times", 
    "smaller, then you would get a capacitance of 1,000", 
    "microfarad.", 
    "Compare that with the Earth, which is only 700 microfarads.", 
    "So a capacitor like this is only 1,000 microfarads.", 
    "If we bring the potential difference over here, then we", 
    "get a tremendous amount of charge on here.", 
    "In fact, if I hold this in my hands and if I assume that the", 
    "potential difference between my left hand and my right hand", 
    "is 10 millivolts, then I would bring on this capacitor 10", 
    "microcoulomb.", 
    "That is a tremendous amount of charge.", 
    "In fact, 10 microcoulomb is the maximum charge we can ever", 
    "put on the big Van de Graaff.", 
    "We calculated it last time.", 
    "If we put more on the Van de Graaff,", 
    "it goes into discharge.", 
    "And by simply holding this in my hands, I could put 10", 
    "microcoulomb here on this capacitor.", 
    "Now you may say, well, yeah.", 
    "But the potential difference between your right hand and", 
    "your left hand, 10 millivolt, isn't that funny.", 
    "No, not really.", 
    "In the future, I will give a lecture and then discuss", 
    "electrocardiograms.", 
    "And you will see, then, that there is a potential", 
    "difference between the left side of your body and the", 
    "right side, which is several millivolts.", 
    "So it's not as artificial as you may think.", 
    "Actually, we'll take a cardiogram in class so you can", 
    "see it really working.", 
    "How much energy can I store in a capacitor?", 
    "Well, we already calculated that.", 
    "We have the energy.", 
    "This was the plate capacitor, 1/2 QV.", 
    "And we can now substitute in there the capacitance, C, and", 
    "the C is Q divided by V. And so this", 
    "is also 1/2 CV squared.", 
    "That's one and the same thing.", 
    "So either you take the charge on the capacitor multiplied by", 
    "V or you take the capacitance and multiply it by V squared.", 
    "The capacitance is never a function of the charge that is", 
    "on the object.", 
    "If you look here, the capacitance is only a matter", 
    "of geometry.", 
    "And when you look there, the plate capacitance is only a", 
    "matter of geometry.", 
    "Never does the charge show up in there.", 
    "So I mentioned that I can bring 10 microcoulomb on this", 
    "capacitor, and yet, on the Van de Graaff, I can also only", 
    "bring 10 microcoulomb.", 
    "That's the maximum I can do before it goes into breakdown.", 
    "We can think of a capacitor as a device that can store", 
    "electric energy.", 
    "I will now return to my promise that I was going to", 
    "demonstrate to you that I have to do positive work when I", 
    "create electric fields.", 
    "In other words, when I take these two charged plates and I", 
    "bring them further away from each other, that", 
    "I do positive work.", 
    "And how am I going to show that to you?", 
    "I have two parallel plates.", 
    "They're on the table there.", 
    "You're going to see them shortly projected there.", 
    "And we have here a current meter.", 
    "I put an A in there for amperes.", 
    "Symbolic for current meter.", 
    "And I'm going to have a power supply and put a potential", 
    "difference over here.", 
    "This is the capacitance, C. We normally use for a capacitor", 
    "the symbol of two parallel lines.", 
    "I'm going to put a potential difference V over the", 
    "capacitor of 1,000 volts.", 
    "So let me put a delta here to remind you that there's a", 
    "difference between the two plates.", 
    "As I do that, as I connect the power supply to these two", 
    "ends, charge will flow on here and so you will see a very", 
    "short surge of current.", 
    "So the ammeter will give you, only for the short amount of", 
    "time that I'm charging, will show you that", 
    "there is charge flowing.", 
    "And you will see that.", 
    "But that's not really the goal of my demonstration.", 
    "What I'm now going to do is I'm now going to increase the", 
    "separation, the distance, d, of these two plates.", 
    "And remember that the potential difference over the", 
    "plates, which I call now a capacitor, is the electric", 
    "field times the distance.", 
    "And the electric field is constant.", 
    "If I charge the capacitor up with a certain charge, there", 
    "is +Q here, there is -Q there.", 
    "And then I remove the power supply, it's no longer there.", 
    "That charge is trapped.", 
    "That charge can never change.", 
    "And so if the charge doesn't change, the charge surface", 
    "density doesn't change, and so the electric field inside", 
    "remains constant.", 
    "So exactly what we did there.", 
    "And now I'm going to move them further apart, therefore I'm", 
    "going to make d larger, and that can only happen if the", 
    "potential difference between the plates increases.", 
    "And I will start off with 1,000 volts, whereby d is 1", 
    "millimeter, and then I will open up this gap up to 10", 
    "millimeters.", 
    "And then I have a potential difference of 10,000 volts.", 
    "But since the energy in the capacitor is 1/2 Q times the", 
    "potential difference, V--", 
    "this V is the same as this delta V. And if Q is not", 
    "changing, but if I go from V of 1,000 volts to 10,000", 
    "volts, it's very clear that I have done work.", 
    "I have increased the", 
    "electrostatic potential energy.", 
    "And this is what I want to show you.", 
    "We're going to have that there.", 
    "So I'll change my television and I'll have to change the", 
    "lights a little bit so that you can see that well.", 
    "Let's wait for the light to settle.", 
    "And we want also the current meter.", 
    "So the one on the right there is the amp", 
    "meter, the current meter.", 
    "And you see here, these two plates, they are separated now", 
    "by about 1 millimeter.", 
    "I have here a very thin sheet, transparency, which I can move", 
    "in between to make sure that they don't make contact.", 
    "And here is my power supply.", 
    "And I have there this propeller-type thing, which is", 
    "some kind of a volt meter.", 
    "And if it's going to move in this direction, that means", 
    "that the voltage between the plates increases.", 
    "And so I'm going to charge it now with a potential", 
    "difference of 1,000 volts.", 
    "And as I do that, you will see a very short surge here on", 
    "this amp meter.", 
    "That's not very spectacular, but at least you can see, for", 
    "the first time in your life, that charge is actually", 
    "flowing from my power supply onto the plates.", 
    "You will see psssht, and that's it.", 
    "It will only be a current as long as the charge is flowing.", 
    "So let me first do that.", 
    "Look at the ammeter there.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero.", 
    "That's all it took to charge these plates.", 
    "It's now fully charged.", 
    "1,000 volts difference.", 
    "And now, as I'm going to increase the gap, there's no", 
    "reason for any charge to go away from the plates, so the", 
    "amp meter will do nothing, but you're going to see this", 
    "propeller-- which indicates the potential difference", 
    "between the plates--", 
    "you're going to see it move because I'm", 
    "doing all this work.", 
    "I'm going from 1 millimeter to 10 millimeters.", 
    "I'm creating all these electric fields, and this hard", 
    "work pays off in terms of increasing the potential from", 
    "1,000 volts to 10,000 volts.", 
    "So there I go.", 
    "I'm 2 millimeters now.", 
    "Look at the voltmeter.", 
    "It's going.", 
    "Three millimeters.", 
    "I'm doing all this hard work while you're doing nothing.", 
    "4 millimeters.", 
    "I'm creating electric fields.", 
    "You should be proud of me.", 
    "I'm creating an electric field.", 
    "Look at that.", 
    "The electric field remains constant between the plates", 
    "because the charge is trapped.", 
    "The charge can't go anywhere.", 
    "I'm now at 7 millimeters.", 
    "7,000 volts.", 
    "8,000 volts.", 
    "I'm at nine millimeters.", 
    "9,000 volts.", 
    "Notice that the ammeter does nothing.", 
    "No charge is flowing through the plates, no charge is", 
    "flowing from the plates.", 
    "I'm now at 10 millimeters, and now I have created a huge", 
    "volume electric field and the potential difference is 10", 
    "times larger than it was before.",
