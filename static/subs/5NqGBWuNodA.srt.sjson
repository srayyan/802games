    "WALTER LEWIN: Let's first do outside the cylinder.", 
    "The Gauss surface, clearly, is going to be itself a cylinder.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "You can give it any random length, l, cannot have any", 
    "effect on the answer.", 
    "And so the end is flat, perpendicular", 
    "to the axis of symmetry.", 
    "And this front part is flat, and this is curved.", 
    "I give this a radius little r.", 
    "And so I know that, everywhere on the surface of that", 
    "cylinder outside, that the electric field must be the", 
    "same everywhere because the distance is the same.", 
    "That's a symmetry argument.", 
    "Electric field cannot be any stronger here than it is there", 
    "if I'm on that surface.", 
    "Symmetry argument number one.", 
    "Symmetry argument number two is, given the fact that this", 
    "is a cylinder, the electric field must everywhere be", 
    "perpendicular to this axis coming out.", 
    "I call it radially, but it is, of course, not", 
    "radially like a sphere.", 
    "It's radially coming out of this surface, always", 
    "perpendicular to this axis of symmetry.", 
    "Nature could not decide any other way.", 
    "That's a second symmetry argument.", 
    "Once you recognize that argument, the electric flux", 
    "through this flat surface and through that flat surface must", 
    "be 0 because then the electric field and the local dA vector,", 
    "which is the perpendicular to the surface, make angles of 90", 
    "degrees with each other.", 
    "Because E would be like this here, but dA is in the", 
    "direction of the axis of symmetry.", 
    "So no flux can, therefore, get out here and get out here, but", 
    "only through this curved surface.", 
    "But on this curved surface, if it is a positive charge, then", 
    "the E vector and the dA are in the same direction.", 
    "If it is a negative charge, they", 
    "are in opposite direction.", 
    "Later you can change the sign of rho.", 
    "Let's just make it positive for now.", 
    "So if now I apply Gauss' Law, then I only have to take this", 
    "surface into account and not these two end pieces.", 
    "And so I need to know now what this surface is.", 
    "Because E and dA are always in the same direction everywhere,", 
    "thus the cosine of the angle between them is plus 1.", 
    "And so what is the surface area?", 
    "That is going to be l times 2 pi little r.", 
    "And then the electric vector is everywhere the same there.", 
    "That was our symmetry argument.", 
    "And that is now the charge inside this cylinder divided", 
    "by epsilon 0.", 
    "But, of course, the charge inside the cylinder, that's", 
    "only the portion that is in this inner cylinder, and so", 
    "that has also then length l.", 
    "The cross section here is pi R squared.", 
    "So this is the volume of the charge that I have inside my", 
    "Gaussian surface.", 
    "I must multiply by rho, that gives it a charge, and I", 
    "divide by epsilon 0.", 
    "And, of course, the l cancels as it always does.", 
    "And the pi cancels here, too.", 
    "And so I find that the electric field equals R", 
    "squared times rho divided by 2 epsilon 0 r.", 
    "And if you want to see it vectorially, you could put an", 
    "r roof there.", 
    "r roof then would be a vector which is", 
    "perpendicular to the axis.", 
    "I mentioned earlier I call that radially outwards.", 
    "So this is the electric field outside the cylinder, R", 
    "squared rho over 2 epsilon 0 r.", 
    "So it falls off as one over r", 
    "So now I want to know what it is inside the cylinder.", 
    "So now I go to r less than or equal to R. So it's clear that", 
    "what I do now, I'm going to have a Gaussian surface, which", 
    "again is a cylinder.", 
    "It has length l.", 
    "And it has, again, two flat pieces at the end, so no flux", 
    "will go through those two pieces.", 
    "So my first term of Gauss' Law is going to be the same.", 
    "I have l times 2 pi little r, because the radius of this", 
    "inner circle is also r.", 
    "l 2 pi r times the electric field--", 
    "the arguments are identical.", 
    "But now, there is less charge inside my Gaussian surface.", 
    "The volume is l now times pi little r squared--", 
    "and then I get rho to convert it to charge--", 
    "divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "I lose my l, as I always do.", 
    "My pi goes.", 
    "And so now I get E equals--", 
    "there's an r here and there's an r squared here, and so I", 
    "only end up was one r--", 
    "divided by 2 epsilon 0.", 
    "And if you like that vector notation, you", 
    "can always do this.", 
    "And, of course, if rho were negative, then automatically", 
    "you see if you put a negative charge density in here, then", 
    "the E field flips over.", 
    "So that's automatically taken into account", 
    "both here and there.", 
    "But let's take a look at it.", 
    "I'm quite happy with that.", 
    "If you substitute little r equals capital R, you are", 
    "right at the surface of your cylinder, then you get the", 
    "same answer in both cases.", 
    "Substitute R, capital R, in here, then the magnitude of", 
    "E-- don't worry about the direction now-- is rho capital", 
    "R divided by 2 epsilon 0.", 
    "And if you put in here for this little r, capital R, you", 
    "find exactly the same answer.", 
    "So we can now make a plot of the electric field as a", 
    "function of distance r, here being capital R, and here", 
    "being the electric field strength.", 
    "It's a linear line.", 
    "0 here, goes up to a certain maximum, and then it falls off", 
    "as 1 over r.", 
    "And this value here is this value.", 
    "That's where little r is capital R.", 
    "It is obvious and pleasing that the electric field on the", 
    "axis itself, where little r is 0, that that", 
    "electric field is 0.", 
    "That is something that you could have predicted almost", 
    "without any knowledge because you have", 
    "symmetry all around it.", 
    "There is charge on the left, there is charge on the right.", 
    "There is charge on north and south.", 
    "And the electric fields, right at the center, of course, all", 
    "pair each other out.", 
    "And so you get no electric field right at the center.", 
    "If the charge, for some reason, would all be at the", 
    "outer surface--", 
    "if it were a solid conductor that would be the case--", 
    "then the electric field would be 0 everywhere inside.", 
    "And this would be unchanged, assuming then that you have", 
    "the same amount of charge on the outside per unit length as", 
    "you now have on the inside.", 
    "So that is cylindrical symmetry.", 
    "I am dying to take a look at my top, I am really.", 
    "And much to my shock do I see that this", 
    "top is still rotating.", 
    "So maybe I'll have to come to the conclusion that there is", 
    "something wrong with 8.01.", 
    "There must be a layer deeper than 8.01.", 
    "There is friction, and yet this top", 
    "doesn't come to a halt.", 
    "And so that layer deeper, maybe that", 
    "layer deeper is 8.02.", 
    "Give that some thought.", 
    "It may add to your sleepless nights.", 
    "We'll visit it later because maybe it will come to a stop.", 
    "Very well.", 
    "Let's now do something very different.", 
    "I have two conducting flat plates,", 
    "call it a plate capacitor.", 
    "And it has a certain thickness.", 
    "The material is a conducting material,", 
    "has a certain thickness.", 
    "It's very large in size.", 
    "Way bigger is the plane, linearly, than this", 
    "separation.", 
    "And let this separation be little d.", 
    "And I charge the upper plate with a positive charge.", 
    "So I get here surface charge density plus sigma and here", 
    "minus sigma.", 
    "Area is A, of both plates.", 
    "I know that in the conductor itself there is no current.", 
    "And, therefore, in the conductor itself, the electric", 
    "field must be 0.", 
    "I have an electric field between the two plates--", 
    "which can be derived using Gauss' Law, but we have", 
    "already used up our time on Gauss' Law--", 
    "which is sigma divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "And the electric field outside these two plates is very close", 
    "to 0 here and also very close to 0 here.", 
    "We find that from the superposition principle", 
    "because this plate, which is negatively charged, will add", 
    "to the electric field pointing down.", 
    "And as you, perhaps, remember, that that is", 
    "independent of distance.", 
    "Well, provided that you are not so far away from the", 
    "plates, that the dimension of the", 
    "plates is going to interfere.", 
    "If the plate is 10 by 10 meters, then it's fine as long", 
    "as you are, say, within a few meters.", 
    "But if you go 100 meters away, then it's not true anymore.", 
    "So if we assume that we don't go too far out, then the", 
    "electric field due to this one pointing down, due to this one", 
    "is pointing up, and they have equal strength.", 
    "They're independent of distance, so they cancel each", 
    "other here, and they cancel each other there.", 
    "Superposition argument.", 
    "Let this point be P inside the conductor and this point be S.", 
    "And the first thing I would ask you, for instance, is what", 
    "is VP minus VS?"
