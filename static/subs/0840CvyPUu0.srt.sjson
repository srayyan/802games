    "WALTER LEWIN: Now, if you have an eddy current going around,", 
    "and you have a magnetic field, then the magnetic field and", 
    "the eddy current will cause a torque on the current.", 
    "In a similar way, when we discussed earlier the idea of", 
    "a motor that you were going to build, there was a magnetic", 
    "field, and there was a current that caused a torque in the", 
    "same way you get a torque on the eddy current.", 
    "And so it starts to torque up this conducting sphere.", 
    "And all the time, there will be eddy currents, because the", 
    "magnetic field keeps going around.", 
    "And so you're going to get a torque, which will always be", 
    "in the same direction.", 
    "And this conducting object will now start to rotate, and", 
    "we call that an induction motor.", 
    "Induction motors have no brushes.", 
    "How fast the induction motor will go depends on the", 
    "conducting object.", 
    "If it is a sphere, it will probably come very close to 60", 
    "Hertz, because a sphere has many possibilities for eddy", 
    "currents to run around, whereas if you take a ring,", 
    "and we will try that, if you try to spin a ring in a", 
    "rotating magnetic field then of course the various paths", 
    "that are available for eddy currents are very limited.", 
    "It can only go around in the ring.", 
    "Many of the stationary tools that you find in people's", 
    "workshops and in the basements are induction motors.", 
    "A table saw and drill presses.", 
    "Also, electric grass mowers are induction motors.", 
    "I want to demonstrate now to you what 3-phase", 
    "currents can do.", 
    "And the first thing I'm going to do is show you that unit", 
    "that we have here, which are the coils that I described,", 
    "through which we are going to run the 3-phase current.", 
    "I must get my lights right.", 
    "There you see it.", 
    "Coils are wound in a very strange way.", 
    "After class, you can come a little closer.", 
    "And so in here, you would have a rotating magnetic field.", 
    "We use 60 Hertz.", 
    "It rotates around 60 times per second.", 
    "And the first thing I'm going to do is something wild, a", 
    "little bit in style I suppose.", 
    "I will put on top there a cardboard", 
    "cover with little magnets.", 
    "They're randomly oriented.", 
    "There's no way that they can ever rotate, these are these", 
    "little magnets.", 
    "Flat, a lot of friction.", 
    "If I expose them to rotating magnetic fields, then they", 
    "will go nuts.", 
    "I told you they were going nuts.", 
    "I'm not supposed to show this to students, but OK.", 
    "Now here, I have a conducting egg.", 
    "And this now has ample possibilities for eddy", 
    "currents to flow.", 
    "And so now, if I give these coils the right current, a", 
    "3-phase current, it spun up, magnetic fields act on the", 
    "eddy currents, and it starts to spin.", 
    "And I have actually tried to measure the rotation rate.", 
    "It's only a little bit under 3,600 RPM.", 
    "3,600 RPM would be 60 Hertz.", 
    "It's very close to that.", 
    "If I spin this object in the direction in which the", 
    "magnetic field is not rotating, then it", 
    "says sorry, no way.", 
    "It just reverses, because the magnetic field is going to", 
    "slave it in the direction that it wants it to go.", 
    "So you're looking there at an induction motor.", 
    "I have here a ring.", 
    "Now, a ring doesn't have as many possibilities for eddy", 
    "currents to run.", 
    "It could only go around like this, or like this, right?", 
    "But I can still make it spin, probably, if I", 
    "do the right thing.", 
    "First of all, I have to rotate it in the right direction,", 
    "which would be this one, I think.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "It doesn't go anywhere nearly as fast as the egg because of", 
    "the restrictive path of the eddy currents.", 
    "But it rotates.", 
    "It's trying to follow that magnetic field to the best it", 
    "can, but its abilities are very limited.", 
    "And needless to say, if I try to spin it in the wrong", 
    "direction, that of course it will stop.", 
    "And it has no way, like the egg, to reverse its direction,", 
    "because of its peculiar geometry.", 
    "I owe you an explanation to the secret top, if you haven't", 
    "found one yourself yet.", 
    "Let me first come to a simple conclusion.", 
    "And all of you must have come to that conclusion.", 
    "That top, when I showed it to you during my exam review, was", 
    "spinning for more than an hour.", 
    "In fact, it was spinning the next day.", 
    "Energy has to come from somewhere, and so the only", 
    "conclusion that you could have drawn, that the energy came", 
    "from inside the box.", 
    "There must be something inside the box.", 
    "Clearly, there must be a battery in that box.", 
    "And there is, but that doesn't tell you how it works yet.", 
    "And I can assure you, I can admit that it took me quite a", 
    "while before I fully understand how it works.", 
    "And I want to explain that to you, and then I will", 
    "demonstrate it to you again.", 
    "Remember what it looks like.", 
    "In the top itself is a magnet.", 
    "So here is a top.", 
    "Let's say this is north, and this is south.", 
    "And this is that top.", 
    "We're rotating it.", 
    "We're spinning it.", 
    "Inside the box, right at the center of", 
    "the box is a solenoid.", 
    "A switch and a nine volt battery.", 
    "Inside this solenoid is also a little bit of iron.", 
    "We have not discussed that in our course.", 
    "It's not important for the explanation.", 
    "You'll later understand why there is also", 
    "some iron in here.", 
    "It makes the magnetic fields just a little stronger.", 
    "This is right at the center of the little platform on which I", 
    "was running this.", 
    "This is a concave platform, and here is a", 
    "little plastic knob.", 
    "So when the top hits it, it bounces off.", 
    "Imagine for now that it's rotating in such a way that", 
    "the north pole is approaching that solenoid.", 
    "Coming in from above.", 
    "What's going to happen now in this solenoid, in this coil,", 
    "you are changing the magnetic flux through the", 
    "surface of this coil.", 
    "And so you're introducing an induced EMF.", 
    "An induced current.", 
    "And this current is sensed by a transistor, which I have not", 
    "put in here.", 
    "And the transistor throws this switch, and now sucks energy", 
    "out of the battery and runs current, very high current", 
    "through this coil.", 
    "Such that the top becomes a south pole.", 
    "Remember, if you have a coil and you run current through", 
    "here, that you get a magnetic field like so.", 
    "In this case, this would be north pole, and this would be", 
    "south pole.", 
    "If you reverse the current, then this is", 
    "south, and this is north.", 
    "That magnetic field that comes out there is fanning out in", 
    "all directions, three dimensionally.", 
    "It's going like this, and it's fanning out like this.", 
    "So when it approaches this coil, there is a change in", 
    "magnetic flux.", 
    "And this becomes a south pole.", 
    "The north pole is being attracted by the south pole.", 
    "I make you look at this from above now.", 
    "Here is the top seen from above, so it's spinning in", 
    "this direction .", 
    "And let's say here is this coil.", 
    "This is the north pole, and this is the south pole.", 
    "And I just discussed with you that the current that's going", 
    "to flow from the battery will make this a south pole.", 
    "The current can only flow in that coil in one direction.", 
    "That's just the way it's designed.", 
    "So whenever a current goes, it's always this becomes a", 
    "south pole.", 
    "The north pole is being attracted by the south pole,", 
    "so notice it's going to be torqued up.", 
    "So far, so good.", 
    "A little later in time, looking from above, the north", 
    "pole will be here, and the south pole will be there.", 
    "It has rotated a little bit further.", 
    "And the coil is here.", 
    "So now the north pole is leaving.", 
    "It's receding.", 
    "It's not approaching, it's receding.", 
    "If this were to remain a south pole, it would be disastrous,", 
    "because south poles and north poles would", 
    "attract each other.", 
    "You don't want that.", 
    "Well, the transistor senses that the EMF in the coil", 
    "reverses direction.", 
    "It has to reverse direction because if the north pole", 
    "comes in, the EMF is in one direction, but when the north", 
    "pole leaves, the EMF of course goes in the other direction.", 
    "You've got a reversal.", 
    "And so what the transistor does, it opens the switch.", 
    "And so there is no north pole here, and there is", 
    "no south pole here.", 
    "And so the thing starts to go around further.", 
    "What happens now when the south pole", 
    "approaches that solenoid?", 
    "OK, here is the situation that the South Pole is now", 
    "approaching, rotating in this direction.", 
    "And here is the coil.", 
    "South pole is coming in.", 
    "From Faraday's point of view, there is no difference between", 
    "the north pole receding or the south pole approaching.", 
    "You should be able to reason that for yourself.", 
    "That's exactly the same thing.", 
    "And so the transistor knows that indeed, the current is", 
    "still in the wrong direction.", 
    "It keeps the switch open.", 
    "It does nothing.", 
    "So as the south pole approaches, no current", 
    "through this coil.", 
    "Because remember, the current can only go in one direction.", 
    "Can only make this a south pole.", 
    "It could have been designed in such a way that the current", 
    "could go in both directions.", 
    "That would have made it more expensive.", 
    "Just a matter of economy.", 
    "So nothing will happen here.", 
    "But now there comes a time that the", 
    "south pole is leaving.", 
    "It's receding.", 
    "And so let us have here our coil.", 
    "A south pole receding is exactly the same for Mr.", 
    "Faraday as a north pole approaching.", 
    "And so now the EMF is in the same direction in the coil as", 
    "it was here.", 
    "And so now the transistor says, yippee, that's fine.", 
    "I close the switch, and I'm going to run a current.", 
    "And so this becomes a south pole.", 
    "South pole and south pole repel each other.", 
    "So now the thing gets a kick again.", 
    "So when the north pole approaches, it pulls on the", 
    "north pole.", 
    "And when the south pole recedes, it pushes on the", 
    "south pole.", 
    "And so it is an induction motor which is only powered", 
    "half per full rotation.", 
    "A very, very clever design.", 
    "And I'm going to demonstrate it to you again.", 
    "I want you to see that as this top approaches the center,", 
    "that actually you can see it starting spinning up.", 
    "It really gets its energy when it gets close to this coil.", 
    "It also works, doesn't matter in which", 
    "direction you spin it.", 
    "That's also great.", 
    "You can spin it clockwise or counterclockwise.", 
    "Makes no difference.", 
    "And so you're going to see that top here.", 
    "I think.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "And this is probably the best way for you to see it.", 
    "We have here, this box in which there is this very", 
    "simple circuit.", 
    "Very simple.", 
    "And here is the top.", 
    "Has a little bar magnet in it.", 
    "I will try to spin it just a little bit, to make you see", 
    "that it actually spins up.", 
    "May not be so easy for you to see, but I can see-- oh, you", 
    "see it's really spinning up now.", 
    "And then it loses to friction, rotation rate.", 
    "It always comes back to the center because", 
    "the surface is concave.", 
    "And then it gets to the center there, it kicks again.", 
    "It gets spun up.", 
    "And this can go on for as long as your battery lasts.", 
    "It's about a few days.", 
    "I can also rotate it counterclockwise.", 
    "It's not so easy.", 
    "It's funny.", 
    "Have you ever tried to run to rotate a top counterclockwise?", 
    "It's very hard.", 
    "I don't know why that is.", 
    "Maybe because I'm right handed.", 
    "I'll try.", 
    "You see, I failed.", 
    "It's a nice one.", 
    "I gave it a teeny little spin.", 
    "Doesn't like it.", 
    "It stays near the center.", 
    "Oh, doesn't like that.", 
    "It has to be a little bit away from the center.", 
    "I think I got it now.", 
    "Oh no, oh no.", 
    "Too optimistic.", 
    "Isn't it strange that it's hard for a person to rotate", 
    "something counterclockwise?", 
    "OK, I did it.", 
    "Slowly coming in to friction now.", 
    "When it gets close to the center,", 
    "there it gets its kicks.", 
    "Now it's spinning up.", 
    "Ah, you can really see it now.", 
    "It's being spun up.", 
    "You see that?", 
    "Really spun up.", 
    "I have another fantastic toy for you, which is also an", 
    "induction motor.", 
    "And that one you're going to see there.", 
    "I first want to explain to you how that one works.", 
    "That's a real beauty.", 
    "It is an induction motor that runs on a 2-phase current.", 
    "Here we have solenoids.", 
    "This baby here, big one.", 
    "And we're going to run 60 Hertz AC", 
    "current through there.", 
    "And here we have one.", 
    "Also going to run 60 Hertz AC through there.", 
    "Here's the coil.", 
    "This one is easy to show.", 
    "The other one, very heavy.", 
    "These two currents are 90 degrees out of phase.", 
    "Not 120, but 90.", 
    "So it's a 2-phase current.", 
    "So when the current is maximum through this one, it is zero", 
    "through this one."
