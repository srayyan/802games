    "WALTER LEWIN: I double omega.", 
    "Two things are changing now.", 
    "For one thing, that the full period now goes from here to", 
    "here, only in half a second.", 
    "But there's something else that changes.", 
    "The EMF now doubles, because look at my equation.", 
    "It's hiding behind the blackboard, I think.", 
    "There is an omega in there.", 
    "It's linearly proportional to omega, because it's d phi/dt", 
    "that matters.", 
    "So the omega pops out.", 
    "And so you now get double the EMF.", 
    "So the 3.5 millivolts maximum would become 7.", 
    "And so if I try to make a drawing of that twice as high", 
    "here, twice as low here, then you would get", 
    "something like this.", 
    "And so this omega is now twice this one.", 
    "You get double the maximum value of the EMF.", 
    "I'm going to show that here.", 
    "I'm going to improve on my lights.", 
    "You see there, a current meter, which is sign", 
    "sensitive, can go to the right, can go to the left.", 
    "And I'm going to rotate this loop.", 
    "When you rotate a loop in a magnetic field, you can even", 
    "rotate it in such a way that you get no EMF.", 
    "I can show that to you easily.", 
    "If this is the loop, and if somehow the magnetic field", 
    "came in like this, if you rotated in this loop now", 
    "around this axis, there would never be an EMF.", 
    "Because the dA and B would always be perpendicular to", 
    "each other.", 
    "So there's never any flux going through this system.", 
    "No flux change.", 
    "But of course, if you rotate it around this direction, it", 
    "will be fine.", 
    "So think about that.", 
    "Don't fall in that trap.", 
    "You can rotate in such a way that there is no flux change.", 
    "We don't have that problem at all, because the magnetic", 
    "field here on earth, in Boston, doesn't come straight", 
    "from heaven down, but it comes rather steep.", 
    "So there's never any problem here.", 
    "I don't have to worry about that.", 
    "So here is that loop, 42 windings.", 
    "The scale there is in microamperes.", 
    "So if you want to, you can calculate what the resistance", 
    "of the loop is when I rotate, but that's", 
    "really not my objective.", 
    "I want you to see that when I rotate it that you get an", 
    "alternating current.", 
    "Very modest, because I rotate very slowly.", 
    "Now I rotate faster.", 
    "That is proportional to omega.", 
    "And so if I rotate faster, you've got a much larger", 
    "maximum induced current.", 
    "A larger EMF, a larger current.", 
    "I don't know how fast I can go.", 
    "This is about as fast as I can go.", 
    "Get's almost up to four microamperes maximum.", 
    "And so we are producing here AC, Alternating Current.", 
    "We have slipping contacts here so that the", 
    "system doesn't break.", 
    "And we could put a light bulb here somewhere in this line,", 
    "and then the light bulb may glow.", 
    "In United States, what comes out of the wall is 60 Hertz.", 
    "So that means that the current through a light bulb becomes", 
    "zero 120 times per second.", 
    "120 times per second do you go through 0,", 
    "if you have 60 Hertz.", 
    "Does it mean that 120 times per second there is no light", 
    "from the light bulb?", 
    "No, it doesn't mean that.", 
    "Because filaments get hot, and so they still glow even when", 
    "the current is 0.", 
    "But they don't cool that fast.", 
    "If you take a fluorescent bulb then, indeed, a fluorescent", 
    "tube goes completely off and on 120 times per second.", 
    "And therefore, you can use them very nicely as", 
    "stroboscopes.", 
    "But of course, the frequency is fixed.", 
    "You can't change the frequency.", 
    "It's 120 Hertz.", 
    "So now, you're getting the idea of an electric generator,", 
    "or what we call, if you want to, a dynamo,", 
    "which produces AC.", 
    "You have a turbine, and the turbine rotates conducting", 
    "loops in magnetic fields.", 
    "And that, according to Faraday, will then", 
    "produce your EMF.", 
    "And that runs our economy.", 
    "You have a permanent magnet and you rotate conducting", 
    "loops, windings, in that magnetic field.", 
    "The higher your magnetic fields, the higher the EMF.", 
    "The faster you rotate, the higher the EMF.", 
    "The more windings you have, the higher the EMF.", 
    "And the larger the area of your loops, the higher the", 
    "EMF, as you can see on the equation that I keep hiding.", 
    "That's where it is.", 
    "In the United States we have 60 Hertz, as I mentioned.", 
    "And we are committed to a maximum voltage coming out--", 
    "that is the maximum value that you get from", 
    "your alternating voltage--", 
    "of 110 times the square root of 2 volts.", 
    "And we call that 110 volts.", 
    "In Europe, we have 50 Hertz.", 
    "And the maximum voltage there, in the oscillation, is 220", 
    "times the square root of 2.", 
    "You cannot change omega and go faster somewhere where you", 
    "generate this electricity, because that would have major", 
    "consequences.", 
    "Number one, the EMF that comes out of the wall would go up.", 
    "So you might blow your television, your circuits.", 
    "But besides that, you would change, also, the frequency of", 
    "the alternating current.", 
    "And there are many systems that run in such a way that", 
    "they're locked into that frequency.", 
    "For instance, many electric clocks and certainly record", 
    "players, if you still have one, are", 
    "locked into the 60 Hertz.", 
    "And so if you were to increase omega, your record player", 
    "would go around faster, and you clocks would go faster.", 
    "A long time ago when I came over from Europe, I brought my", 
    "record player with me.", 
    "The record player requires 220 volts, so I bought a", 
    "transformer here to convert the 110 volts at my home would", 
    "become 220, doubles fine.", 
    "And so to record player was happy.", 
    "It was running.", 
    "But it ran 20% too fast, because I had overlooked that", 
    "there are 60 Hertz here and 50 Hertz in Europe.", 
    "It was going a little bit too fast.", 
    "And you know what that means when it goes too fast.", 
    "It sounds very crazy.", 
    "You can't even hear the music.", 
    "And that's exactly what happened", 
    "with my record player.", 
    "So if we look at a power station, as we discussed", 
    "earlier in this course, and let us suppose to get some", 
    "numbers, that the maximum EMF that the power station", 
    "produces, let's say, is 300 kilovolts, which", 
    "it puts on the line.", 
    "And let's say we have loops that have an area of about one", 
    "square meter, and that they use magnetic fields, which", 
    "are, let's say, half a tesla.", 
    "By no means unreasonable numbers.", 
    "And if now you want 60 Hertz frequency, so your frequency f", 
    "is 60 Hertz--", 
    "So your omega is about six times higher 2 pi higher.", 
    "It's about 360 radians per second."
