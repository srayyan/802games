    "WALTER LEWIN: Who thinks A goes inwards?", 
    "Very good.", 
    "Who says A goes outwards?", 
    "OK.", 
    "A will go inwards if the two Van de Graaffs", 
    "have the same polarity.", 
    "So if that doesn't happen, that doesn't mean that physics", 
    "doesn't work.", 
    "It means the two Van de Graaffs have different", 
    "polarities.", 
    "And we'll see what happens.", 
    "So let me first, then, create a dipole.", 
    "So here is the dipole.", 
    "It's shorted out now.", 
    "I turn on this Van de Graaff.", 
    "So induction takes place.", 
    "Remember that the yellow is pointing towards the Van de", 
    "Graaff, and that the orange is away from the Van de Graaff.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So I induce a dipole.", 
    "Oh, I really should redo that.", 
    "I don't know what happens when it--", 
    "I have to remove the field first.", 
    "OK.", 
    "The yellow was inside, right?", 
    "Was that the way it was?", 
    "OK.", 
    "Yellow inside.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "So now it's creating the dipole through this metal bar.", 
    "And I break contact.", 
    "And this should now be a dipole.", 
    "Now I turn on the field of the--", 
    "So if the polarity is the same, yellow will go in.", 
    "I will try to swing it a little.", 
    "Notice two things.", 
    "It's going to line up beautifully radially, but the", 
    "yellow is not in.", 
    "The yellow is out.", 
    "So the two Van de Graaffs have different polarities.", 
    "But you will see they rotate nicely, and they are", 
    "beautifully radial.", 
    "And when I go all the way around here, again, they may", 
    "swing a little.", 
    "They may oscillate a little.", 
    "But through damping, they will come to a halt.", 
    "And look, the field is indeed beautifully radial.", 
    "And the yellow is pointing outwards.", 
    "The two Van de Graaffs have different polarities.", 
    "So you have seen how we can create a dipole, and you have", 
    "also seen how we often can make statements about the", 
    "specific polarity.", 
    "I can probe an electric field using grass seeds in oil.", 
    "Grass seeds are elongated, and when I put a grass seed in the", 
    "electric field, it will become polarized.", 
    "There's nothing you can do about it.", 
    "Here's a grass seed.", 
    "And the electric field is like so.", 
    "And so the electrons want to go as far away in this", 
    "direction as they can for induction.", 
    "And so this side remains positive.", 
    "And so what is this grass seed going to do?", 
    "It's going to rotate.", 
    "It's going to line up with the electric field.", 
    "And this is the way that I'm going to show you now field", 
    "configurations in the vicinity of a dipole.", 
    "And I will also show you, then, field configurations in", 
    "the vicinity of two charges which have equal polarity.", 
    "You may have seen this in high school with magnetic fields,", 
    "with iron filings.", 
    "That's kid stuff.", 
    "That's the easiest thing to do.", 
    "This is the real thing.", 
    "This is the electric fields.", 
    "I bet you've never seen electric fields which are", 
    "traced by these mysterious seeds.", 
    "So I'll give you some light that may optimize the", 
    "demonstration.", 
    "These seeds first have to be oriented in a way", 
    "so that it is chaos.", 
    "The first thing you see is I'm going to make this--", 
    "I believe is going to be a dipole first.", 
    "Almost certain.", 
    "So I'm going to charge one positive, and", 
    "charge the other negative.", 
    "And then we'll see how these grass seeds", 
    "will form each other.", 
    "Watch closely.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "My goodness.", 
    "That is a wonderful dipole field.", 
    "Of course, we don't know which one is plus or minus, because", 
    "the grass seeds have no arrows on them.", 
    "But you clearly see these incredible lines.", 
    "Radially inwards or outwards on each one of the charges,", 
    "and then you see these nice arcs in between.", 
    "Who could see it easily?", 
    "OK, you got something worth for your tuition.", 
    "Put a little bit more charge on, maybe.", 
    "Very clear.", 
    "And now, which is perhaps more interesting, I'd like to show", 
    "you the field surrounding two charges.", 
    "But now the charges are both the same polarity.", 
    "So we have to undo the memory of the grass seeds.", 
    "OK, now we'll try to make them both the same polarity.", 
    "And watch this hair blower effect that I told you about.", 
    "Look at that.", 
    "Great.", 
    "Now you really clearly see these field lines, and you see", 
    "in between, how the two air blowers are competing with", 
    "each other.", 
    "Very impressive.", 
    "All right, so that's the way you see field lines now.", 
    "Electric field lines.", 
    "And some of you may have seen, with iron filings, magnetic", 
    "field lines.", 
    "If I have the Van de Graaff, and I have the Van de Graaff", 
    "here, and let's suppose the Van de Graaff is positive.", 
    "I don't know whether it's positive or negative, I", 
    "suppose it's going to use the one over there.", 
    "And I'm going to stand here on the ground.", 
    "Walter Lewin.", 
    "What is going to happen with me?", 
    "Through induction, the electrons being sucked out of", 
    "the earth and coming up because they want to go close", 
    "to the positive charge.", 
    "So I would become negatively charged.", 
    "What will the field lines do?", 
    "Oh, it will be extremely complicated.", 
    "Very complicated.", 
    "But something like this, maybe.", 
    "Maybe something like this.", 
    "Some may come out here.", 
    "Some may end up on my neck here.", 
    "Some may go here, like so.", 
    "Very complicated field configurations.", 
    "But I want to probe that field somehow, a little.", 
    "Get a feeling for what that field is like.", 
    "And the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to", 
    "put a charged balloon.", 
    "There you see the balloon, it's a conductor.", 
    "I'm going to put a charged balloon, and put it here, say.", 
    "Well, if it is a positively charged balloon, it will take", 
    "off in that direction, right?", 
    "The force is always tangential to the field lines.", 
    "It will abandon the field lines.", 
    "It won't stay on the field lines.", 
    "There's a lot of denting on the balloon, that's why I", 
    "chose the balloon.", 
    "So it will move relatively slowly, and it will ultimately", 
    "maybe end up on my head right here.", 
    "Once it ends up on my head there, so it comes in maybe", 
    "like this, now it will get a negative charge from my head.", 
    "And so it will become immediately negatively", 
    "charged, and so the force now will reverse, and will be in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "Tangential to this field line.", 
    "And so it will go back.", 
    "When it hits the Van de Graaff again, it will", 
    "get positive charge.", 
    "Reverses polarity, and it will go back again.", 
    "So it will bounce back and forth between me and the Van", 
    "de Graaff, and it gives you some rough feeling of what", 
    "field conservation is about.", 
    "Although I want to remind you that the charge does not", 
    "follow exactly field lines.", 
    "So I'm going to sit here, and I will be part of this.", 
    "That's probably going to be positive.", 
    "I will automatically become negative.", 
    "There's nothing I have to do.", 
    "All I turn is the Van de Graaff.", 
    "Graaff And we have to put a little bit of", 
    "charge on that balloon.", 
    "It will probably do that by itself, but I can always give", 
    "it a little kick so that it goes to the Van de Graaff.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "Oh, actually--", 
    "My glasses are a good insulator.", 
    "So I'd better take my glasses off, so that every time it", 
    "hits me, it changes polarity.", 
    "So this is a way you can do physics and have", 
    "fun at the same time.", 
    "See you Monday."
