    "Inside, touch.", 
    "Inside, touch.", 
    "And every time I come in here, there's no", 
    "electric field in there.", 
    "So I can do that until I'm green in the face.", 
    "Well, there comes a time that I can no longer increase the", 
    "potential of the Van de Graaff, and that is when the", 
    "Van de Graaff goes into electric breakdown.", 
    "When I reach my 300,000 volts, it's all over.", 
    "I can try to bring the potential up, but it's going", 
    "to lose charge to the air.", 
    "And so that is ultimately the limit of the potential of the", 
    "Van de Graaff.", 
    "So how does a Van de Graaff work?", 
    "We have a belt, which is run by a motor.", 
    "Here is the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And right here, through corona discharge, we put", 
    "charge on the belt.", 
    "They're very sharp points.", 
    "And we get a corona discharge at a relatively low potential", 
    "difference.", 
    "It goes on the belt.", 
    "The belt goes here, and right here, there are two sharp", 
    "points which, through corona discharge, take the charge off", 
    "on the inside.", 
    "That's the key.", 
    "And then it goes through the dome, and then it charges up", 
    "to the point that you begin to hear the sparks and that you", 
    "have breakdown.", 
    "And I can demonstrate that to you.", 
    "I built my own Van de Graaff.", 
    "And the Van de Graaff I built for you is this paint can.", 
    "I'm going to charge that paint can by touching it repeatedly", 
    "with a conductor.", 
    "I'm going to touch the conductor with a few thousand", 
    "volt power supply every time.", 
    "This is the power supply.", 
    "I'm turning it on now.", 
    "And you're going to see the potential of the", 
    "Van de Graaff there.", 
    "That is a very crude measure for the potential on the Van", 
    "de Graaff, but very crudely, when it reads a 1, I have", 
    "about 10,000 volts.", 
    "This is the probe that I'm using for that.", 
    "A 2 reached 20,000 volts.", 
    "My power supply is only a few thousand volts, so", 
    "that's not very good.", 
    "Well, I will first start charging it on the outside to", 
    "demonstrate to you that I very quickly run into the wall that", 
    "I just described.", 
    "That if they have the same potential, then I can no", 
    "longer transfer a charge.", 
    "But then I'm going to change my tactics,", 
    "and then I go inside.", 
    "And then you will see that it will go up further.", 
    "So let's first see what happens if I now bring charge", 
    "on the outside.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "About 1,000 volts, about 2000 volts, 2,000 volts,",

    "I don't think we can.",

    "But then came Professor Van de Graaff, and he said, look,",
