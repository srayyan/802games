    "WALTER LEWIN: First, let's review RLC circuits.", 
    "RLC circuits in series.", 
    "I have here a resistor, and I have here a capacitor, and here a self", 
    "inductor, L, and here, I have some kind of a voltage source.", 
    "I call it E, and it could have various different natures, as we", 
    "will see very shortly.", 
    "Let's call this Point b, a, c, d, back to a.", 
    "The way I start these problems always, and there's nothing wrong with that, I", 
    "assume at one moment in time that this is positive and this is negative.", 
    "I assume that there is no charge anywhere on this system on the", 
    "capacitor, and so a current will start to flow after a while, I, that current", 
    "will charge this side of the capacitor positive and this one negative, and it", 
    "will return.", 
    "If we look at the electric fields, there must be an electric field, E,", 
    "here in this direction, there must be electric fields here in the capacitor", 
    "also in this direction, going from plus to minus.", 
    "There is no electric field in the self inductor because the self inductor is", 
    "made of super conducting wire, just as all these wires have no resistance.", 
    "And inside the battery, the E field is opposing.", 
    "It goes from plus to minus.", 
    "I now apply Faraday's law, and I go around this closed loop circuit, and I", 
    "attach to the closed loop an open surface.", 
    "Closed loop integral, and I attach to that an open surface.", 
    "And the open surface is easy to see here.", 
    "It's flat.", 
    "It's not so easy to see here.", 
    "We discussed that earlier.", 
    "It is some staircase kind of a circuit.", 
    "I don't want to go into that anymore, but what is important is that the", 
    "magnetic flux inside the solenoid penetrates this open surface N times", 
    "if you have N windings.", 
    "We hit that very hard last time.", 
    "So here comes Faraday's law.", 
    "The closed loop integral of E dot dl, I split that up into integral in going", 
    "from a to b, plus the integral in going from b to c through the", 
    "resistor, plus the integral in going from c to d through the capacitor,", 
    "plus the integral in going from d back to a through the self inductor.", 
    "And this now, according to Faraday's law, equals minus d/dt of the magnetic", 
    "flux through that open surface, B dot dA.", 
    "And it also equals minus L dI/dt.", 
    "We discussed that last time, so I will not go into that.", 
    "Now, what is the integral in going through the battery, that is minus E?", 
    "Notice I go against the electric field if I go around like this.", 
    "Here, I go with the electric field, so it's plus I R. Here, I go plus the", 
    "electric field, so it is plus Q divided by C. And remember this Q is", 
    "always the charge on the capacitor.", 
    "Nothing else make sense.", 
    "Whenever I use Q, it's always the charge of the capacitor, and of", 
    "course, there is an equal amount of positive charge here as there is", 
    "negative charge here.", 
    "What is the integral from d to a through the self inductance?", 
    "Well, that is zero, because there is no electric field in the self", 
    "inductance.", 
    "Kirchhoff's Law does not hold.", 
    "The closed loop integral E dot dl is not zero.", 
    "It's minus L dI/dt.", 
    "The relation, by the way, between this Q c and the current is I equals dQ on", 
    "the capacitor dt.", 
    "That relates the current with the charge on the capacitor.", 
    "Now, I'm going to reorganize this a little bit.", 
    "I may have to save this one because I may need it later.", 
    "So using I equals +dQ/dt, I find now that Q dot, double dot, plus R over L", 
    "times Q dot plus Q over L C equals that EMF.", 
    "That is the EMF which is the driver.", 
    "It's the one that could have various natures.", 
    "It could be zero.", 
    "It's not necessary that there is an EMF.", 
    "It could very well be that this is just short circuited and that we start", 
    "at some initial condition when the capacitor is charged, we throw a", 
    "switch, and some currents will begin to flow.", 
    "So E could be zero.", 
    "There's also a possibility that E is constant.", 
    "We would call that a battery.", 
    "And then there is the possibility, when we deal with alternating", 
    "currents, that E equals E 0 times the cosine omega t.", 
    "But of course, any other function is possible.", 
    "E could have this function, this profile as a function of", 
    "time, or this one.", 
    "We will only, in 8.02, deal with these two, and I will first", 
    "consider the first two.", 
    "You could also write this one using I equals dQ/dt, that I double dot plus R", 
    "divided by L times I dot plus I over L C equals dE/dt, the derivative of this", 
    "driving voltage, so to speak.", 
    "Now, If we first take the case that the EMF is 0, there is no EMF, or that", 
    "it is constant, then what you're going to see is you're going to get into the", 
    "circuit under certain conditions--", 
    "and I will specify those conditions--", 
    "an alternating current which will ultimately die out.", 
    "And if you think about it a little bit, it's immediately obvious why it", 
    "has to die out.", 
    "We call this regime, the regime of light damping, and I will only discuss", 
    "this regime of light damping, and I will specify what", 
    "exactly I mean by that.", 
    "I choose arbitrarily that I equals 0 when t equals 0.", 
    "And when I do that, I find for a solution, for a constant EMF--", 
    "EMF could also be 0--", 
    "equals I 0 times e to the minus t over 2L divided by R times the", 
    "sine of omega t.", 
    "And the value, 2L over R could be called tau, that is the decay", 
    "constant, and you will see shortly what I mean by that decay constant.", 
    "Omega is now entirely dictated by the various components, L and C and R. We", 
    "call this one--", 
    "and you will see shortly why--", 
    "we call this one omega 0 squared.", 
    "Now, omega has to be real, otherwise this would not have a solution, and", 
    "that immediately tells you then what the conditions are for light damping.", 
    "If 1 over L C is larger than R squared divided by 4L squared, which is a", 
    "condition for a real value for omega, it is required that R be smaller than", 
    "2 times root L over C. That would then be the case that I am discussing today", 
    "of light damping.", 
    "If this is not the case, you get a different behavior", 
    "which I will not discuss.", 
    "What now will the current look like as a function of time?", 
    "Well, here is I which started at I equals 0, that was the initial", 
    "condition, and this exponential decay is like an envelope that pinches the", 
    "current off.", 
    "It will make the current die down.", 
    "The 0 crossings are equally spaced with a period, T, which is 2 pi", 
    "divided by omega.", 
    "And this, then, is very closely the period, T, that I have here, and these", 
    "periods, T, remain constant.", 
    "And this curve here is this e to the minus, and this is then this exponent.", 
    "So this is the envelope which squeezes down the current.", 
    "There is a mechanical analogy, which is easy to see, and that may help you", 
    "a little bit.", 
    "If I have here a spring, and I have an object hanging on the spring with mass", 
    "m, and then it oscillates about this equilibrium position, then what you're", 
    "going to see, if you damp the mass in a way that the frictional force", 
    "opposes the velocity and is linearly proportional to velocity, then you get", 
    "exactly the similar kind of differential equation that we had", 
    "before, except you don't see L, you don't see R, you don't see C. You see", 
    "other symbols like Ms and Vs and whatever.", 
    "I think you've seen them in 8.01.", 
    "This kind of behavior is exactly the same.", 
    "It is an oscillating bob, exponential decay, and when m goes through", 
    "equilibrium, you have here all the energy in the bob in terms of kinetic", 
    "energy, which is 1/2 m v max squared.", 
    "But when the bob comes here to a halt, so v is 0, then you have all the", 
    "energy in potential energy of the spring, which is 1/2 k x max squared.", 
    "And of course, this x max, in this case you would have x here.", 
    "This x max slowly decays in time.", 
    "So what you see here is interesting.", 
    "You see a sloshing back and forth between, on the one hand, all the", 
    "energy in terms of kinetic energy, and then later, everything", 
    "in potential energy.", 
    "And when you're anywhere in between, you have a combination of these two.", 
    "Now in a similar way with the RLC circuits, as the currents oscillate", 
    "back and forth, there is a time that the capacitor has all the energy in", 
    "the form of electric energy.", 
    "That is the situation when I equals 0, and the energy in the capacitor is", 
    "then 1/2 Q 0 squared over C, and it's the maximum value possible, which", 
    "decays with time.", 
    "Everything is in electric energy, and the energy in L, magnetic", 
    "energy, equals 0.", 
    "And then there comes a time that I reaches a maximum, which again dies", 
    "out, the maximum decays, and then Q on the capacitor is 0.", 
    "And then all the energy is in terms of magnetic energy, there's no electric", 
    "energy, and that equals 1/2 L I, which is the maximum value, squared.", 
    "So also here, you see a sloshing back and forth between two different kinds", 
    "of energy, magnetic energy which at one moment in time", 
    "is all in the inductor.", 
    "A little later, a quarter of an oscillation later, everything is in", 
    "terms of electric energy in the capacitor, and it keeps sloshing back", 
    "and forth similar to the oscillating spring."
