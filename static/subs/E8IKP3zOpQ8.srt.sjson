    "WALTER LEWIN: And I can give you an example.", 
    "Suppose I have a plane electromagnetic wave.", 
    "And E 0 is 100 volts per meter.", 
    "That's just what it is.", 
    "How we get it, that's a different story.", 
    "And this could be radio emission.", 
    "This could be infrared.", 
    "This could be light.", 
    "I don't specify the frequency.", 
    "I don't have to.", 
    "Frequency doesn't come up there.", 
    "And so the average value for the Poynting vector--", 
    "I can pick this equation.", 
    "E 0 is 100.", 
    "I know mu 0, I know c.", 
    "So I can calculate what it is.", 
    "It's 100 squared divided by 2, divided by mu 0 divided by c.", 
    "And when I do that, I find that this is 13 watts per", 
    "square meter.", 
    "So imagine that you would stand in this electromagnetic", 
    "wave coming to you.", 
    "We take all our clothes off and we let it hit us.", 
    "And suppose it absorbed us.", 
    "Suppose it is radiation that absorbs us.", 
    "Some radiation may go straight through you.", 
    "Gamma rays may go straight through you.", 
    "They are electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "But certainly light will not go through you.", 
    "And radio waves, some of them will not go through you.", 
    "So you observe them with your body.", 
    "Would you notice that?", 
    "I doubt it.", 
    "You probably have a surface area that's close to one", 
    "square meter--", 
    "13 watts, 13 joules per second, not very noticeable.", 
    "You radiate yourself 100 watts, 100 joules per second.", 
    "So I don't think you will notice that.", 
    "But imagine, now, that we increase the value of E 0 and", 
    "we make it 1,000 volts per meter.", 
    "Now, this goes up by a factor of 100 because if E goes up by", 
    "a factor of 10, automatically B goes up by a factor of 10.", 
    "Remember, electromagnetic waves,", 
    "they are always coupled.", 
    "So the Poynting vector, which is the product of the two,", 
    "goes up by a factor of 100.", 
    "So now you're talking about 1.3", 
    "kilowatts per square meter.", 
    "And if you observe that on your body, believe", 
    "me, it may fry you.", 
    "Certainly, if you do that out on the beach,", 
    "you get a deep suntan.", 
    "And if you do it long enough, then you can hurt yourself", 
    "very badly.", 
    "So now comes the question-- does a light", 
    "bulb emit plane waves?", 
    "Well, not really.", 
    "Plane waves have no beginning and they have no end.", 
    "They exist at all time in all space.", 
    "Look at my plane wave solutions from last lecture.", 
    "You can substitute in there any value for x, y, and z, and", 
    "any moment in time--", 
    "the year 5,000 BC, you get an answer.", 
    "Doesn't specify when.", 
    "Doesn't specify where.", 
    "And of course, that's not very realistic.", 
    "In the real world, there's a beginning, and there is an end", 
    "to the electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "And therefore, they have also a finite length.", 
    "Remember the quarter nanosecond pulses that we sent", 
    "to the moon that we discussed last time were only seven", 
    "centimeters long.", 
    "That's not very much like a plane wave.", 
    "So I want to discuss with you a little further what these", 
    "waves look like.", 
    "And I want to take a closer look at how electromagnetic", 
    "waves are produced by charges that we begin to shake, that", 
    "we are accelerating.", 
    "Key in the whole process is that you accelerate a charge.", 
    "If a charge is just moving at a constant velocity, it will", 
    "not produce electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "But I want to give you some feeling, at least, some", 
    "classical physical feeling on how these electromagnetic", 
    "waves are produced.", 
    "It is a picture that has its own limitations, but it's", 
    "still useful.", 
    "It's not a quantum mechanical treatment, but it's something", 
    "that you and I can see and, therefore, perhaps appreciate.", 
    "Suppose I have here a charge which is not moving--", 
    "just sitting there.", 
    "These are field lines.", 
    "I just draw only a few field lines.", 
    "And if it's a positive charge, the arrows are outwards.", 
    "If it's a negative charge, the arrows are inwards.", 
    "And I'm going to accelerate this for a time delta t.", 
    "Let's accelerate it in this direction.", 
    "And then we bring it, again, to a halt, say.", 
    "I redraw all this.", 
    "This point is the same as this point here.", 
    "I accelerate it, and delta t seconds later, it", 
    "happens to be here.", 
    "So this is t equals zero.", 
    "And this is t equals delta t.", 
    "And now I'm going to draw a circle--", 
    "it should actually be a sphere, three dimensionally,", 
    "about this point.", 
    "And here is that sphere.", 
    "And this sphere has a radius c delta t.", 
    "This field line, which was the field line that goes with this", 
    "charge, is here.", 
    "And this field line is here.", 
    "And this one is here.", 
    "I only draw three--", 
    "this one, this one, and this one.", 
    "And the message that I accelerated this charge could", 
    "not possibly have reached this location in space because that", 
    "message can only travel with the speed of light.", 
    "So the electric field here is exactly the same as it was", 
    "when it was still here.", 
    "So when the object is here, the electric field must still", 
    "be like this here.", 
    "And it must be like this here.", 
    "And it must be like is there because the message hasn't", 
    "reached that point.", 
    "But now look at this charge, which is now here at", 
    "time t delta t.", 
    "Now the electric field is like so, is like", 
    "so, and is like so.", 
    "So this field line must somehow meet up with this one.", 
    "It's one and the same field line.", 
    "And what does that mean?", 
    "That somewhere there, there must be a kink in", 
    "the electric field.", 
    "And there must be a kink here.", 
    "Notice there's no kink here, which is interesting.", 
    "And so it is the collection of these kinks that propagate", 
    "outwards with the speed of light.", 
    "And they produce an electromagnetic", 
    "disturbance, a change.", 
    "If you're out in space here, and if, for instance, I were", 
    "to oscillate this charge back and forth, you would see these", 
    "kinks go by all the time, these breaks in", 
    "the electric field.", 
    "And you would experience that as an electromagnetic wave, if", 
    "there's a changing electric field.", 
    "According to Maxwell's equations, there has to be", 
    "also a changing magnetic field.", 
    "But the interesting thing is, even though this is an", 
    "extremely simple picture, notice that, in this", 
    "direction, if you were here, you would not see any kinks.", 
    "So there's no electromagnetic radiation going in this", 
    "direction, nor is there any going in this direction.", 
    "And the maximum is going in this direction.", 
    "And something in between is going in that direction.", 
    "It's not much of a plane wave, for that matter.", 
    "I mean, if anything, it's more like a spherical wave.", 
    "But it's a very special spherical wave, not the same", 
    "strengths in all directions.", 
    "And so even though this is a rather classical picture, it", 
    "helps me, at least, to see how these changing electric fields", 
    "and therefore associated B fields, are formed by charges", 
    "that we accelerate.", 
    "And I have a two minutes movie that shows that also, in a", 
    "slightly more detailed way than I was able to do.", 
    "And so let's look at that movie.", 
    "Marcos, are you ready for that?", 
    "OK, then you can start that.", 
    "So this is a computer-generated movie", 
    "whereby we accelerate charges.", 
    "This is a constant speed now.", 
    "And we're going to stop it.", 
    "Stopping means there is an acceleration right?", 
    "You may call it a deceleration, but stopping is", 
    "an acceleration.", 
    "It's going to be stopped.", 
    "And you see now here these kinks and they propagate out", 
    "with the speed of light then, if this was", 
    "electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "You're going to see this several times, so you get", 
    "another chance.", 
    "The charge is now stopped.", 
    "You see the magnetic, the electric field", 
    "lines coming out.", 
    "And now it's being accelerated.", 
    "And you see these kinks here?", 
    "Moving out with the speed of light.", 
    "You're going to see more.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "It's going to be accelerated.", 
    "And during the acceleration, only during the acceleration,", 
    "do you see the formation of the kinks.", 
    "When it goes with constant speed, no longer.", 
    "It's only during--", 
    "now it stops.", 
    "Stops means an acceleration.", 
    "There you see this wave front moving out.", 
    "Let's look a little bit more, if you can see", 
    "the oscillating effect.", 
    "So you already have seen this--", 
    "acceleration, here is the wave.", 
    "It stops, that means deceleration.", 
    "And here you see the wavefront.", 
    "And when it's sitting still, or when it's going with", 
    "constant speed, then there's no", 
    "electromagnetic wave produced.", 
    "And now we're going to see some oscillating charges,", 
    "which is more realistic--", 
    "when you have an antenna, and you have currents going up and", 
    "down with frequency omega, you obviously", 
    "have stops and starts.", 
    "It oscillates back and forth.", 
    "And that's what you see now.", 
    "And look at these beautiful--", 
    "there's a wave going out.", 
    "Here's a wave going out-- only during the acceleration.", 
    "There's one going out.", 
    "And there's one going out.", 
    "So you accelerate it, backwards, forwards,", 
    "backwards, forwards.", 
    "I think that's fine.", 
    "Thank you, Marcos.", 
    "So the classic picture, even though it has lots of", 
    "limitations, it's not a quantum mechanical treatment,", 
    "is still very useful.", 
    "For instance, if we think of an antenna, just a straight", 
    "wire with a current going up and down with high frequency--", 
    "it could be 70 megaHertz.", 
    "It could be gigaHertz.", 
    "And you produce electromagnetic radiation,", 
    "then you are accelerating charges up and down by having", 
    "current going like this.", 
    "Then, from this classical picture, we know that no", 
    "radiation will go out in this direction.", 
    "But we also know that in the direction perpendicular to the", 
    "acceleration, that is in this direction, remember here, the", 
    "acceleration was like so.", 
    "And in the direction of the acceleration, no", 
    "electromagnetic waves go out.", 
    "So nothing goes out here.", 
    "Nothing goes out there.", 
    "But in the plane perpendicular to a, which in this case is", 
    "the blackboard, is a whole plane like this, and in this", 
    "case, of the antenna, is the horizontal plane, here we have", 
    "a maximum radiation going out, everywhere in this plane.", 
    "And in between somewhere, it's not zero and it is not the", 
    "maximum value.", 
    "So now I would like to return to the idea of the Poynting", 
    "vector because we talked only about the Poynting vector.", 
    "We derived that in terms of the plane wave solutions.", 
    "And we now know that plane wave solutions are really not", 
    "too realistic.", 
    "Suppose we have the sun here."
