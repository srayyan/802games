    "WALTER LEWIN: And so here we have the cross section of that", 
    "wire, radius R. A current, I, is going through this surface.", 
    "I now have to choose a closed path.", 
    "Since we have cylindrical symmetry, it is clear that we", 
    "would choose a circle, with radius little r.", 
    "So we can be sure that the magnetic field strength is the", 
    "same everywhere because of reasons of symmetry.", 
    "Since the current is coming towards me and I am free to", 
    "choose in which direction I'm going to march--", 
    "I know that the magnetic field is in this direction--", 
    "so I might as well also march in this direction, so that my", 
    "dl's are all in this direction.", 
    "I don't have to do that.", 
    "I could march the other way around.", 
    "But if I march counterclockwise, then both", 
    "terms, left and right, of Ampere's Law will be positive.", 
    "I now have to attach an open surface to my path.", 
    "Well, this will be--", 
    "the blackboard will be that open surface.", 
    "And so now I apply Ampere's Law.", 
    "So I get B times 2 pi little r--", 
    "because dl and r and B are in the same direction-- so it's a", 
    "trivial integral.", 
    "That now equals mu 0 times I, which now penetrates my", 
    "surface, uniquely determined.", 
    "All these currents from this wire that comes to me", 
    "penetrates my surface.", 
    "So times I, and so B equals mu 0 times I divided by 2 pi r.", 
    "And that's the same result that we found last time when", 
    "we applied Biot and Savart.", 
    "So that's no surprise that you see this.", 
    "But now we have a way of finding the magnetic field", 
    "also inside the wire.", 
    "So here we have now the wire again, the cross section.", 
    "Current coming out of the blackboard.", 
    "And now I want a radius which is smaller than capital R. And", 
    "of course, my closed path, again, for reasons of", 
    "symmetry, is going to be a circle with radius r.", 
    "And my surface that I attach is a flat surface.", 
    "And so here I go.", 
    "B times 2 pi little r equals mu 0 times--", 
    "ah, now I have to be careful because now not the full", 
    "current I is now penetrating my surface, but it is only a", 
    "fraction that penetrates the surface.", 
    "And the fraction that penetrates the surface is now", 
    "little r squared divided by capital R squared times I.", 
    "You see, because the total current comes through the", 
    "radius capital R, but I only have now a circle with", 
    "radius little r.", 
    "And so I lose one r here, and so you get a", 
    "very different result.", 
    "You get now that the magnetic field equals mu 0 times I--", 
    "is now linear in little r--", 
    "divided by 2 pi capital R squared.", 
    "And this grows linearly with R, whereas this falls", 
    "off as 1 over r.", 
    "And if you substitute in this equation r equals capital R,", 
    "which then would be the magnetic field right at the", 
    "surface of the wire, you find exactly the same result here.", 
    "Little r becomes a capital R. If little r becomes a capital", 
    "R, you lose one capital R, you get the same result.", 
    "And so if you make a plot of the magnetic field as a", 
    "function of little r, then it looks like so.", 
    "So this is little r.", 
    "This is capital R. And this is the magnetic field strength", 
    "because we know that it is tangentially to these circles.", 
    "It would be straight line, and then here it falls", 
    "off as 1 over r.", 
    "And the maximum value here is the value that you find there", 
    "if you substitute little r equals capital R.", 
    "I will now show you that we can, using Ampere's Law, also", 
    "come very close to calculating the magnetic field inside what", 
    "we call solenoids.", 
    "Solenoids is like a slinky.", 
    "The current that goes around in a spiral,", 
    "one loop after another.", 
    "I want to remind you that if we had a loop, a nice current", 
    "loop coming out of the blackboard here, and the", 
    "current going into the blackboard--", 
    "so there's a circular wire, but I only show", 
    "you the cross section--", 
    "I want to remind you that the magnetic field, as we", 
    "discussed last time, would be clockwise here.", 
    "It would be counterclockwise here.", 
    "In the middle, remember, it was like this.", 
    "And then in between, it was like so.", 
    "That was sort of the magnetic field configuration in the", 
    "vicinity of a loop through which we have a current going.", 
    "But now imagine that you put another loop here.", 
    "Current again coming out of the blackboard, going into the", 
    "blackboard, and another one and so on, several.", 
    "What do you think is going to happen with these magnetic", 
    "field lines, which now diverge?", 
    "They are going to be sucked in here.", 
    "This loop also wants the field lines to come through its", 
    "circle, so to speak, and this one, too.", 
    "And so you're beginning to get a near", 
    "constant magnetic field.", 
    "And the more tightly these loops are wound, the more", 
    "accurately will your magnetic field be", 
    "approximately constant.", 
    "And I have some transparencies which will show", 
    "that in more detail.", 
    "Here we have a figure.", 
    "You see five windings, spiral.", 
    "If you look from the left, the current is going", 
    "in clockwise direction.", 
    "And so the magnetic field is going from this", 
    "side to that direction.", 
    "And when you look here, you see that the magnetic field is", 
    "approximately constant inside.", 
    "And outside these current loops, outside the solenoid--", 
    "we call them solenoids--", 
    "the magnetic field is extremely low.", 
    "And if you start winding these loops very tightly, then you", 
    "get a configuration that looks like this.", 
    "You get an almost perfect constant magnetic field inside", 
    "the solenoid, and the magnetic field outside the solenoid is", 
    "extremely weak.", 
    "And now I would like to calculate with you, using", 
    "Ampere's Law, what that magnetic field inside such a", 
    "solenoid would be.", 
    "And we have to make a few assumptions.", 
    "Let this be my solenoid, and the length of the solenoid is", 
    "capital L. A current, I, is going through like so.", 
    "And I assume that if I look from the left side, that the", 
    "windings are wound clockwise.", 
    "So I know that the magnetic field is", 
    "then in this direction.", 
    "I make the assumption that the magnetic field outside the", 
    "solenoid is approximately 0.", 
    "I will show you later with a demonstration that that's a", 
    "pretty good approximation.", 
    "And so the question now is, what is the", 
    "magnetic field there?", 
    "And I assume I have N loops, N windings, capital N. So now I", 
    "have to choose a path.", 
    "I have to apply Ampere's Law, I choose a path.", 
    "And you may be surprised the path I'm going to take.", 
    "This is the path I choose.", 
    "It's a rectangle.", 
    "And the length of this side, inside the solenoid, is l.", 
    "And I think of this as four different passes-- number 1,", 
    "number 2, number 3, and number 4.", 
    "Let's first look at number 2.", 
    "We have assumed that the magnetic field", 
    "is practically 0.", 
    "So, clearly, if you do the integral, if you go around,", 
    "then the contribution here must be 0 because the magnetic", 
    "field is 0.", 
    "Then the integral B dot dl is 0.", 
    "So that's easy.", 
    "But if you look at 1 and 3, there is no magnetic field,", 
    "very small magnetic field, outside.", 
    "The magnetic field inside is in this direction.", 
    "But dl is like this, if I march like that,", 
    "and B is like this.", 
    "So there's 90 degree angles, and so the dot product is 0.", 
    "And so the only path that contributes to my closed loop", 
    "integral of Ampere's Law is only path 4.", 
    "And that tells me then that B times little l--", 
    "because B is constant, I have assumed that it is constant--", 
    "and I integrate it over a length little l.", 
    "Now I have to agree on my surface.", 
    "What surface am I going to choose to attach to that", 
    "closed loop?", 
    "Well, why not using a flat surface, just like the", 
    "blackboard?", 
    "Now I have to calculate the current that", 
    "penetrates that surface.", 
    "The current that penetrates that surface--"
