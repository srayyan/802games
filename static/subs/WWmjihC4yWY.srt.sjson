    "WALTER LEWIN: --but I will answer it for you.", 
    "The light that contributes to the rainbow is the light", 
    "whereby the minimum angle for delta is about 138 degrees.", 
    "And if you go back to that first transparency you will", 
    "see that that's the case when the angle of incidence is", 
    "about 60 degrees.", 
    "You can download that again.", 
    "And that means that the angle of", 
    "refraction is about 40 degrees.", 
    "40 degrees is very close to the Brewster angle.", 
    "The Brewster angle, if you go from water to air--", 
    "medium where you are is water, and you bounce it off this", 
    "medium, so you go from water to air--", 
    "the tangent of the Brewster angle is n 2 divided by n 1.", 
    "n 2 is where you're going, that's air.", 
    "So this is 1.", 
    "n 1 is where you are, that's the water.", 
    "Let's just call that the index of refraction 1.33.", 
    "If you calculate now what the Brewster angle is, you will", 
    "find that the Brewster angle theta", 
    "Brewster is about 37 degrees.", 
    "That is only three degrees different from this angle,", 
    "which is the crucial one, which", 
    "contributes to the rainbow.", 
    "So you're only three degrees away from the Brewster angle.", 
    "So what happens as this light comes in--", 
    "and I will make a separate drawing--", 
    "now as this light comes in here it's practically", 
    "unpolarized.", 
    "And you should remember the meaning of the parallel and", 
    "the perpendicular component, the way I discussed that with", 
    "you earlier.", 
    "But right here, you are so close to the Brewster angle", 
    "that almost everything that reflects is now polarized in", 
    "this direction, perpendicular to the blackboard.", 
    "And so what comes out here is also polarized perpendicular", 
    "to the blackboard.", 
    "And that would mean then, if you really think through what", 
    "that means, that direction of the polarization, it means", 
    "that the bow is polarized here in this direction, here in", 
    "this direction, here in this direction, and so on.", 
    "And so if you take your linear polarizers, you can hold them", 
    "like this, and you can actually see", 
    "that the bow is polarized.", 
    "And if you put your linear polarizers at 90 degrees", 
    "angles, then you can kill the rainbow.", 
    "It's very highly polarized.", 
    "Is nearly 100% because of the fact that the Brewster angle", 
    "is so very close to the 40 degrees.", 
    "I like to go to Plum Island, which is one hour's drive", 
    "north of here, near Ipswich.", 
    "It's a beautiful beach.", 
    "And you have the ocean in the east, the sun late afternoon", 
    "in the west.", 
    "And then the waves come in.", 
    "And the waves splash up water.", 
    "And I always look for the rainbow.", 
    "I look at my shadow, the sun is there, I look at my shadow.", 
    "Go 42 degrees away from the shadow, wherever there is", 
    "splashing water, [WOOSH]", 
    "for a split second you see the rainbow.", 
    "Red outside blue inside, just for a split second, because", 
    "then there's no water anymore.", 
    "You have to wait for the next wave to come in, the water", 
    "splashes up, [WOOSH]", 
    "rainbow, gone.", 
    "And so a few years ago I took my friend, Bill", 
    "Predorski to the beach.", 
    "And I saw the rainbow.", 
    "I mean, I always look for the rainbow right, it's clear.", 
    "And I pointed out to Bill.", 
    "I didn't make a big deal out of it, because he's a", 
    "physicist so he knows that stuff.", 
    "And so I said to Bill, here, look 42 degrees away from your", 
    "shadow, you see?", 
    "[PSHT, PSHT].", 
    "He looked at it.", 
    "Didn't see nothing.", 
    "I looked at it again, [PSHT]", 
    "beautiful rainbow.", 
    "Bill, nothing.", 
    "I got extraordinarily annoyed with Bill.", 
    "I said, man, look at it.", 
    "The rainbow is as crystal clear as you can have it.", 
    "What's wrong with you?", 
    "He says, I don't think there's anything wrong with me.", 
    "He says, maybe there's something wrong with you.", 
    "Yeah.", 
    "Just imagine.", 
    "And then I looked at Bill.", 
    "And I remember what he looked like.", 
    "He looked like this.", 
    "And then I said to myself, ah, I understand why he doesn't", 
    "see the rainbow.", 
    "He's wearing polarized sunglasses.", 
    "And the polarization of the", 
    "sunglasses is in this direction.", 
    "So every time that I saw this beautiful", 
    "rainbow here, [PSHT].", 
    "He had his glasses in this direction,", 
    "he killed the rainbow.", 
    "So I said, Bill, would you please take your glasses off?", 
    "He took the glasses off and he said, there's", 
    "nothing wrong with you.", 
    "I see the rainbow.", 
    "So, whenever you want to see the rainbow at the beach make", 
    "sure that you don't wear your polarized sunglasses.", 
    "Now I will demonstrate to you the rainbow.", 
    "And what I will do is use one drop of water.", 
    "This is exactly what we discussed earlier.", 
    "One drop of water, light goes on to the drop, comes back,", 
    "here is that one drop of water.", 
    "And here is the light.", 
    "I'm going to blind you.", 
    "You see this water drop?", 
    "You've seen it.", 
    "I'm going to put this to make sure that your", 
    "eyes don't get blinded.", 
    "And this light will come in your direction.", 
    "And in this water drop all these things", 
    "are going to happen.", 
    "All these angles of i occur.", 
    "And so light will come in this direction.", 
    "And I will project it on the screen.", 
    "And what will you see?", 
    "You will see white as the inside.", 
    "You'll see red on the outside.", 
    "And that light that comes out near the edge, it's very", 
    "strongly polarized, I will show that to you.", 
    "You can't see that with your polarimeters because once it", 
    "hits the screen and it comes back at you it loses the", 
    "direction of polarization.", 
    "So you cannot use your personal polarizers.", 
    "So I will lower the screen.", 
    "I will also make it dark and give you 30 seconds for your", 
    "eyes to adjust to the light.", 
    "Because you can imagine, I've only one drop of water.", 
    "So don't expect too much.", 
    "You can't do much with one drop of water.", 
    "And what you're looking at is really not the", 
    "rainbow itself, of course.", 
    "The angle of 42 degrees is only as measured from this one", 
    "water drop, not from where you are sitting.", 
    "If you're sitting very far in the audience the bow looks", 
    "smaller than when you're close.", 
    "Because you only see the intersection of that", 
    "cone with my screen.", 
    "But it has all the ingredients of the rainbow.", 
    "And with a little bit of imagination, you may be", 
    "thinking that you see the rainbow.", 
    "That will be fine with me.", 
    "So, we'll make it dark so that your eyes will adjust.", 
    "We'll give it a few seconds for your eyes to adjust.", 
    "In the meantime, I can find my polarizer.", 
    "It's here.", 
    "Look at it!", 
    "Look at it!", 
    "There it is.", 
    "Isn't it fantastic?", 
    "You see the beautiful arc here.", 
    "All the way, red on the outside.", 
    "Exactly as I predicted.", 
    "Blue on the inside.", 
    "I admit, the blue is not as blue as you would like to see.", 
    "But I can see the blue quite well.", 
    "And look at all this white light.", 
    "And you know now where all this white light comes from.", 
    "And so the bow is polarized tangentially to the arc.", 
    "So the polarization is in this direction, here.", 
    "But the polarization is in this direction, here.", 
    "And I will show you that.", 
    "I have a polarimeter here.", 
    "I turn the polarimeter so that the light goes through.", 
    "Now the light goes through.", 
    "Now I'm going to turn it and you'll see it", 
    "gets completely dark.", 
    "Not only are the colors gone, but the white", 
    "light is also gone.", 
    "Because the white light is also polarized.", 
    "I'll do it here, again.", 
    "The angle is now a little different.", 
    "You see the light go through, and you can", 
    "see that very clearly.", 
    "I'm going to rotate.", 
    "And you see, it gets dark, gets dark, the colors are", 
    "gone, and the white light is gone.", 
    "And now, for the first time in your life, you understand why", 
    "this is the case.", 
    "Now the next time that you're going to see a rainbow, you", 
    "will look at that rainbow in a very, very different way.", 
    "For one thing, you will check that the red is outside.", 
    "You will make sure that it's bright insight the bow.", 
    "That it's dark outside.", 
    "You will look for the secondary.", 
    "And you will convince yourself that the color sequence of the", 
    "secondary is different from the primary.", 
    "This is a contagious disease which you", 
    "cannot resist anymore.", 
    "Your life will never be the same.", 
    "And I'll be very proud of you if from now on you will always", 
    "carry a linear polarizer with you.", 
    "And I gave you three, so you better.", 
    "So that every time that you see a rainbow, you can be", 
    "absolutely sure that the bows are indeed polarized.", 
    "And because of your knowledge, you will be able to see way", 
    "more than just the of beauty of the bows that", 
    "everyone else can see.", 
    "Your knowledge will add something very, very special.", 
    "And maybe you'll be thinking of me.", 
    "Thank you.", 
    "See you Friday."
