    "WALTER LEWIN: What is remarkable and not intuitive", 
    "that the time to go around, as long as we don't have to make", 
    "relativistic corrections, that the time for a proton to go", 
    "around is independent of its speed.", 
    "Not so intuitive.", 
    "And you can see that very easily, because the time to go", 
    "around is 2 pi R divided by its speed.", 
    "You see, the radius is proportional to v. And so the", 
    "time itself is independent of v, because R itself is", 
    "linearly proportional with the speed.", 
    "And so that cancels.", 
    "And so you'll find now that the time to go around is", 
    "simply 2 pi times the mass of that particle divided by q B.", 
    "And if you correct relativistically, then you", 
    "have to multiply by gamma.", 
    "But if you stay non-relativistic, then it's", 
    "independent of the speed of the protons.", 
    "So if we stick to this particular case of our 1 MeV", 
    "proton that became a 50 MeV proton going around 1,225", 
    "times, this time to go around once is only 66 nanoseconds.", 
    "So this is 6.6 times 10 to the minus 8 seconds, to give you", 
    "some feeling of how fast all this is going.", 
    "So if you go around 1,225 times, that will take only 80", 
    "microseconds.", 
    "So in 80 microseconds, does all of this occur.", 
    "And that means you have to switch this field twice per", 
    "full rotation.", 
    "Make sure that the E field is in this direction.", 
    "But when the proton comes here, the E field has to be in", 
    "that direction.", 
    "And so the switch in frequency, which can easily be", 
    "calculated, becomes about 30 million times per second,", 
    "about 30 megaHertz.", 
    "And all of that takes place in 80 microseconds.", 
    "And you create 1 MeV protons, you turn", 
    "them into 50 MeV programs.", 
    "A mind boggling concept, but it works.", 
    "Quite remarkable.", 
    "Now because of the relativistic corrections that", 
    "you see here with gamma, if you go to very high energies,", 
    "then the time is not constant for a full rotation.", 
    "So you have to adjust now the frequency with which you", 
    "switch the potential between these gaps.", 
    "So if the time increases, then this switch in frequency has", 
    "to go down.", 
    "And we call those instruments synchrotrons, or", 
    "synchrocyclotrons, they have names.", 
    "So you synchronize now and correct for", 
    "relativistic effects.", 
    "Modern accelerators have constant radii.", 
    "They are rings.", 
    "And so if you have a ring with constant radius, the only way", 
    "that you can keep the particles in the ring when", 
    "they have a low energy and when they have the high energy", 
    "is by gradually increasing the magnetic field.", 
    "So you start off with a weak magnetic field.", 
    "You go around a huge circle, very large radius, and you", 
    "gradually increase the magnetic fields as you keep", 
    "accelerating them.", 
    "And by making the magnetic field go up just in the right", 
    "way, maybe all the way up to 2 Tesla, you can keep", 
    "them in that ring.", 
    "The first slide that I'd like to show you is the slide of an", 
    "ancient cyclotron.", 
    "It is actually a synchrocyclotron.", 
    "It was built by Lawrence and Berkeley.", 
    "And this was capable of accelerating", 
    "protons to 730 MeV.", 
    "You see here a person to give you a feeling for the size of", 
    "this instrument.", 
    "Lawrence received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1939 for", 
    "his invention of the cyclotron.", 
    "The next slide is Fermilab near Chicago.", 
    "This is one of these modern accelerators.", 
    "They're also called sometimes colliders.", 
    "And this has a diameter of 2.2 kilometers.", 
    "And this instrument this year plans to accelerate", 
    "protons up 1,000 GeV.", 
    "G stands for giga.", 
    "Giga is the same as billion.", 
    "So 1,000 giga electron volts would be 10 to", 
    "the 12 electron volts.", 
    "Beams of high energy protons are made to collide with other", 
    "nuclei to uncover the inner workings of nuclear physics.", 
    "The higher the energy of the protons, the larger is the", 
    "impact when the protons collide, and the more one", 
    "expects to learn.", 
    "By using ever increasing energies of the protons, which", 
    "are nuclear bullets, one explores unknown territory.", 
    "In the news, these colliders are", 
    "often called atom smashers.", 
    "That is a flashier name which appeals more to the general", 
    "public who pays for all this with their tax money.", 
    "This research is a multi-billion dollar industry.", 
    "The words atom smasher are actually a misnomer.", 
    "The colliders smash nuclei, which are 10,000 times smaller", 
    "than atoms.", 
    "The next slide shows you the tunnel of the largest ring in", 
    "the world, which is in Geneva at CERN, which is a European", 
    "collaboration.", 
    "This tunnel, which already exists for many years, has a", 
    "circumference of 17 miles, has a radius of 4.3 kilometers.", 
    "And in here are these protons being accelerated, of course", 
    "in the high vacuum.", 
    "And with very modern techniques of superconducting", 
    "magnets, they can even go up now to about 5 Tesla.", 
    "And in this tunnel right now, a whole new experiment is", 
    "under development, which is called the Large Hadron", 
    "Collider, which is considered the holy grail for particle", 
    "physicists.", 
    "And it's hoped that it will go on the air in the", 
    "year 2007 or so.", 
    "And it will accelerate protons to an unprecedented energy.", 
    "It will give them kinetic energies of 7,000 GeV--", 
    "7 times 10 to the 12 electron volts.", 
    "Do you recognize me?", 
    "Yes, I am Walter Lewin.", 
    "And it is now 2013.", 
    "A few months ago, the LHC made one of the most important", 
    "discoveries in particle physics of all times.", 
    "One of the main objectives of the LHC was to prove or", 
    "dispprove the existence of the Higgs boson, which was already", 
    "hypothesized about 45 years ago.", 
    "The Higgs boson is part of what's called the standard", 
    "model of particle physics, which is a set of rules that", 
    "lays out our understanding of the fundamental building", 
    "blocks of the universe.", 
    "And the LHC has discovered the Higgs boson.", 
    "It has a mass of about 125 GeV.", 
    "And there is little doubt in my mind that the Nobel Prize", 
    "for this major discovery will be awarded very soon.", 
    "Let's now go back to 2002.", 
    "So I would like to return to my overhead there so that you", 
    "can see some of what we just discussed.", 
    "Right there.", 
    "Thank you, Tom.", 
    "So here we have Fermilab.", 
    "You see a radius of 1.1 kilometers.", 
    "I showed you a picture from the air.", 
    "And so they went up to 1.5 tesla.", 
    "So that's the maximum magnetic field strength.", 
    "It gets very close to the speed of light, by the way.", 
    "And you see 500 GeV protons.", 
    "And here you see the holy grail, the Large Hadron", 
    "Collider, European collaboration in Geneva at", 
    "CERN, whereby you have the circumference of 17 miles, and", 
    "the magnetic field that they hope to achieve going up to 5", 
    "and 1/2 tesla using modern techniques of superconductors.", 
    "So if you want to go around in these tunnels, by the way, you", 
    "need a motorcycle, if you go 17 miles around.", 
    "The goal of all this physics, of all these experiments, is", 
    "to enter new territory, to learn about these mysterious", 
    "nuclear forces, and to see what is inside protons and to", 
    "see what is inside neutrons.", 
    "With these experiments, many nuclear particles were", 
    "discovered whose existence was completely unknown previously.", 
    "Now comes the issue, how can you see the results of these", 
    "collisions of these particles with very high energies?", 
    "Well, you can make the tracks of these particles visible.", 
    "In fact, today you will see them with your own eyes.", 
    "And in the old days, this was done with cloud chambers.", 
    "And that's the demonstration I will do today for you.", 
    "But nowadays they do them with bubble chambers.", 
    "Let's first understand the principle.", 
    "If you have a charged particle, whether it is an", 
    "electron or a proton or an alpha particle--", 
    "alpha particle is the nucleus of helium, it's", 
    "2 protons, 2 neutrons--", 
    "if it goes through the air, it makes ions.", 
    "And as it goes through the air and it makes ions, it slowly", 
    "loses its kinetic energy.", 
    "And it finally comes to a halt.", 
    "If we take a 10 MeV electron in 1 atmosphere air, it could", 
    "go 40 meters.", 
    "If you take a proton of 10 MeV, it would only go 1 meter,", 
    "because the density of ions is higher because it", 
    "has a higher mass.", 
    "And if you take an alpha particle which has a higher", 
    "mass than a proton and it has a double charge of a proton,", 
    "then it would only go 10 centimeters.", 
    "It's a very high density track that you would get from an", 
    "alpha particle.", 
    "And so one way you can see these tracks", 
    "is using cloud chambers.", 
    "And a cloud chamber works in principle as follows.", 
    "You can just have a chamber in air, 1 atmosphere air.", 
    "But you put liquid with alcohol in there-- that's the", 
    "way we will do it--", 
    "and you cool the bottom.", 
    "You see one there, which you will see a little later.", 
    "And you cool the bottom with solid CO2.", 
    "And when you get inside this chamber, you get", 
    "a temperature gradient.", 
    "And there's a layer there where the alcohol should", 
    "really condense into little drops, because it's that cold.", 
    "But for reasons that are complicated, it", 
    "doesn't do it quite yet.", 
    "We call that under-cooled alcohol.", 
    "Even rain can be under-cooled.", 
    "Just below freezing point, it's still liquid.", 
    "And the moment it hits the ground, it would immediately", 
    "become solid, by the way.", 
    "That's also under-cooled liquid.", 
    "Now here we deal with an under-cooled vapor.", 
    "And so when these ions are made by these charged", 
    "particles, these ions act as seeds for the drops, in this", 
    "case the alcohol drops.", 
    "And you can literally, with your eyes, visually see these", 
    "drops being formed.", 
    "I'd like to go through one numerical example.", 
    "And I want to go to a 500 keV electron, which you see there.", 
    "Notice that I corrected the speed relativistically,", 
    "otherwise you would get this ridiculous number that we", 
    "calculated earlier, which is larger than", 
    "the speed of light.", 
    "And suppose we have a 0.1 Tesla field.", 
    "Then the radius will be 2.9 centimeters.", 
    "But after a while, this electron will lose its energy.", 
    "And then there comes a time that it has only 100 kilo", 
    "electron volt left.", 
    "By that time, the radius in a 0.1 Tesla field would now be", 
    "1.1 centimeters.", 
    "And so when you look at cloud chambers at the tracks of", 
    "electrons and you have magnets there, you will see the tracks", 
    "being curled up, which, of course, is the result of the", 
    "fact that the radius got smaller in time.", 
    "And since the magnetic field is constant, you can see,", 
    "then, large radius here.", 
    "And as the kinetic energy slowly decreases, the radius", 
    "gets smaller and smaller and smaller.", 
    "So let's look at a few more slides.", 
    "In 1932, Anderson noticed a track in a cloud chamber which", 
    "had the appearance of an electron.", 
    "It had the right mass, it had the right charge.", 
    "But the direction of curvature was wrong.", 
    "And so he concluded that it was an electron which was", 
    "positively charged, which is now called a positron.", 
    "And these positrons had been predicted on purely", 
    "theoretical grounds by Dirac.", 
    "And Anderson received the Nobel Prize for his discovery", 
    "in 1936, only four years after he discovered the positron.", 
    "And Dirac had already received his Nobel Prize in 1933 for", 
    "his theoretical work.", 
    "The bubble chamber is an advanced form", 
    "of the cloud chamber.", 
    "In the bubble chamber, liquid hydrogen is used.", 
    "And if now the ions go through, the ions become the", 
    "seeds now for little gas bubbles.", 
    "So you have liquid, which really should have been gas,", 
    "but it's not quite.", 
    "And so now it forms gas bubbles.", 
    "So in a cloud chamber, you're going to see the drops.", 
    "In a bubble chamber, you see gas bubbles.", 
    "But the idea is the same.", 
    "And Glaser, who invented these chambers--", 
    "he's also from Berkeley, by the way-- he got the Nobel", 
    "Prize for that in 1960.", 
    "So let's look at the discovery by Anderson.", 
    "Here you see a positron coming from above.", 
    "And this positron has 63 MeV kinetic energy.", 
    "And Anderson puts half a centimeter of lead in there,", 
    "which was very clever.", 
    "Think about that.", 
    "When it comes out, the energy now is less.", 
    "This goes in, the lead, it produces a lot of ions.", 
    "And so it loses a lot of kinetic energy.", 
    "And it comes out with roughly 23 MeV.", 
    "And why did he do that?", 
    "Because now he knows for sure that this", 
    "particle came from above.", 
    "Because when it loses energy, the radius is smaller.", 
    "That's why he was sure that it was curved", 
    "in the wrong direction.", 
    "If he didn't have the lead, you never know whether the", 
    "electron came this way, in which case the curvature would", 
    "be perfect.", 
    "But now he knows it comes from above.", 
    "And if this had been an electron, it would", 
    "have curved this way.", 
    "So this is one of the early discovery cloud chamber", 
    "photographs by Anderson.", 
    "The next slide is a bubble chamber.", 
    "And you see here both a positron and an electron in a", 
    "constant magnetic field.", 
    "And it speaks for itself.", 
    "Notice that the curvatures are exactly in opposite", 
    "directions--", 
    "and you see this spiral structure that I", 
    "discussed with you--", 
    "as the electrons lose their energy.", 
    "And since this is a bubble chamber, which has an enormous", 
    "density, 1,000 times higher density, say, than air, these", 
    "electrons don't travel 40 meters in these chambers.", 
    "In air, they would.", 
    "But in this case, it is substantially less.", 
    "And so you can roll them up nicely.", 
    "And you can study, then, their momentum and their charge.", 
    "Using accelerators and cloud chambers and bubble chambers,", 
    "a whole new world of nuclear physics emerged.", 
    "And between 1958 and '68, 30 new nuclear particles were", 
    "discovered.", 
    "And MIT has always been on the forefront in this research.", 
    "Professor Sam Ting, who's still at MIT, got the Nobel", 
    "Prize in 1976.", 
    "Steven Weinberg, theoretician, who did his work while he was", 
    "at MIT, got his Nobel Prize in 1979.", 
    "Jerry Friedman, still at MIT, and Henry Kendall got the", 
    "Nobel Prize for their work in 1990.", 
    "And Clifford Shull got his Nobel Prize in 1994.", 
    "If I summarize the basic idea behind it, which is very", 
    "relevant to 8.02, you accelerate these particles", 
    "using electric fields.", 
    "That's the only way you can accelerate them.", 
    "Magnetic fields can only be used to confine them, but", 
    "cannot change their kinetic energy.", 
    "But magnetic fields are crucial, because that allows", 
    "you, as you gradually increase their speed, to confine them,", 
    "either by a ring, which is done nowadays, or, in the old", 
    "days, in these chambers of the cyclotrons and the", 
    "synchrotrons.", 
    "And then we have the bubble chambers.", 
    "In the old days, the cloud chambers, whereby you use", 
    "magnetic fields to get information on the radius of", 
    "these particles as they are being detected.", 
    "And out of all this emerged a whole new way of looking at", 
    "our world, and completely new ideas about what makes the", 
    "world tick.", 
    "This is nothing short of a revolution.", 
    "And so now I want to enjoy with you the last five minutes", 
    "of this lecture by looking at a cloud chamber and by looking", 
    "at some of these tracks.", 
    "You're going to see a lot of electrons in there.", 
    "The walls of the cloud chamber are radioactive, just like you", 
    "are radioactive.", 
    "Your bones are radioactive.", 
    "Your windows are radioactive.", 
    "They emit electrons, no protons.", 
    "But they certainly emit electrons.", 
    "And we have in there a radioactive isotope, a rod", 
    "which has thorium in it, which produces alpha particles.", 
    "And so you're going to see electrons which make beautiful", 
    "spiderweb structures.", 
    "Please don't clean up yet.", 
    "We have plenty of time.", 
    "To be precise, we have 5 minutes and 18 seconds left.", 
    "So these electrons, you will see them going like spiderwebs", 
    "through this chamber.", 
    "And sometimes they change abrupt direction, because they", 
    "can collide, particularly when they have low energy.", 
    "And then they fly off, so to speak.", 
    "And then occasionally, we may see an alpha particle coming", 
    "from our radioactive thorium.", 
    "And that makes a very thick track.", 
    "And so let's try this.", 
    "We have an expert here, which is Marcos, who has not only", 
    "borrowed this instrument--", 
    "and if you like it, we may actually buy it.", 
    "It's not cheap.", 
    "But we may buy it.", 
    "But he borrowed it especially for you, for which I'm very", 
    "grateful, Marcos.", 
    "And he also did quite a bit of work to get", 
    "the light just right.", 
    "It's not so easy to see those tracks.", 
    "So Marcos, you will get a chance to adjust the lights,", 
    "if you want that.", 
    "We're going to make it very dark.", 
    "And let's enjoy, then, this wonderful world, invisible", 
    "world, of nuclear physics.", 
    "So here you see this rod with thorium.", 
    "So Marcos, feel free to adjust the light, if", 
    "you feel the need.", 
    "I will go into the audience as well and see whether we can", 
    "identify the electrons.", 
    "Oh, there was an alpha particle.", 
    "So this is this rod.", 
    "And so the bottom of this chamber is", 
    "cooled with solid CO2.", 
    "Ah, there was an electron--", 
    "very nice.", 
    "As I said, they almost looks like spiderwebs.", 
    "That was an electron here.", 
    "So also keep an eye on this rod.", 
    "And occasionally you will see a very dense track, which then", 
    "indicates--", 
    "there was one.", 
    "That's an alpha particle.", 
    "There's a beautiful alpha particle.", 
    "Just enjoy this.", 
    "You're looking at a world which is completely new.", 
    "Think about it.", 
    "You're looking at the world of nuclear physics.", 
    "You're seeing individual electrons.", 
    "And occasionally, you see alpha particles.", 
    "Here, there's one coming out.", 
    "And think about the physics, what's going on here.", 
    "This alcohol which refuses to become drops.", 
    "And then these ions say, we force you to become-- here is", 
    "an alpha particle.", 
    "I don't know what it's doing there.", 
    "So these ions force this alcohol vapor to become drops.", 
    "It's an incredible, complex picture that", 
    "you're looking at.", 
    "It is amazing every time I see this.", 
    "It's absolutely fabulous.", 
    "And all through these very simple rules.", 
    "Let's think about it.", 
    "We have the Lorentz force that makes these particles go", 
    "around, electric fields that you can use them to accelerate", 
    "them, and then this subtle way that you can actually make", 
    "them visible, individual particles visible.", 
    "It is a new world.", 
    "And the goal of my lecture was to make you peek into this", 
    "world which has revolutionized our whole way of thinking.", 
    "Thank you."
