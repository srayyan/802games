    "WALTER LEWIN: Well, that's immediately obvious.", 
    "If this can is positively charged, but if the water is", 
    "negatively charged, the negative charge wants to go to", 
    "the positive can.", 
    "And so it spreads out.", 
    "So it's clear that by the time that you reach almost a spark,", 
    "that that water will spread out quite substantially.", 
    "And you will see that.", 
    "And then when there's a discharge, it will start", 
    "running again narrow stream, and then slowly, in time, the", 
    "water will spread.", 
    "And so now I will do a series of demonstrations which will", 
    "support what we know and what we perhaps don't know.", 
    "Let's first give a little bit of light here because", 
    "we will need that.", 
    "And I'm going to make it completely dark so that you", 
    "get maximum pleasure for your money.", 
    "And I will first show you here the gap, those two poles.", 
    "And this time we have a real treat, which we owe to Marcos,", 
    "who's standing behind the instrument very modestly.", 
    "This time, we have a gauge, a meter, which measures the", 
    "electric fields very close to can A. And the reason why that", 
    "is nice is that as this system charges up, we just don't have", 
    "to wait now just until we see the spark.", 
    "But we can look at the galvanometer there and slowly", 
    "see it being charged up.", 
    "And then we get a spark, and then it discharges.", 
    "So you get a lot more for your money.", 
    "So I propose that the first thing we do is what we did", 
    "last time, that we simply let it run and see", 
    "whether we get a spark.", 
    "There's always air bubbles in the system, which", 
    "I have to get out.", 
    "OK, I think I did that.", 
    "OK, let's just be patient.", 
    "Ah, it starts already.", 
    "Look at it.", 
    "Look at the E field.", 
    "Bing!", 
    "First spark.", 
    "Can you see this spark on the screen?", 
    "Look at it again.", 
    "There's a spark.", 
    "And at the same time, you see how the electric field goes", 
    "away, charges up, bang, charges up, bang.", 
    "So it starts the whole system charged because of a random", 
    "positive or negative charge that would be present on one", 
    "of the cans.", 
    "What I want to do now is I want to increase the gap", 
    "between the two poles, and I make it so large that you will", 
    "never achieve an electric field there of three million", 
    "volts per meter.", 
    "But somewhere else on the unit, it has lots of sharp", 
    "edges and sharp points, somewhere else the electric", 
    "field will reach the breakdown voltage.", 
    "And so the system will go into", 
    "discharge, into corona discharge.", 
    "You will never see sparks, but it goes into discharge.", 
    "And you can see that because now, I will open the gap now.", 
    "If you now look at the electric field, it will reach", 
    "a maximum value, and now it goes into discharge.", 
    "You see, it begins to sort of sputter a little", 
    "bit back and forth.", 
    "So now there is no longer a spark on the poles.", 
    "You don't see anything between the poles.", 
    "But it is somewhere else.", 
    "I don't know where.", 
    "Where there is a continuous stream now of charges leaving", 
    "the system, and so it's", 
    "discharging to corona discharge.", 
    "And so in this mode, you expect the water to be spread", 
    "all the time.", 
    "And I will show that to you by switching now to the water.", 
    "Maybe Marcos, you can improve on the light.", 
    "I could turn this off, maybe you'll see it better.", 
    "But you see that the water is spread.", 
    "And I will now bring the two poles closer together.", 
    "I also want to see, of course, the electric fields, to see", 
    "the discharge.", 
    "So I bring them closer together,", 
    "stopping the corona discharge.", 
    "There's a spark.", 
    "And now watch the water.", 
    "See the water is now just not interesting,", 
    "and there it spreads.", 
    "I'll turn the light off.", 
    "You look at the water.", 
    "Slowly the system is charging up.", 
    "You see the water?", 
    "Bingo.", 
    "You can even tell by the water when it sparks.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "Now I want to do something real mean.", 
    "What I want to do now is to raise the spout so high that A", 
    "cannot reach out all the way to the spout.", 
    "It's too far away, and cannot polarize the water.", 
    "So the poor battery cannot start.", 
    "That's pretty mean thing to do to a battery.", 
    "But on the other hand, I'm not all bad.", 
    "What I can do is I can start the system.", 
    "I can help the system.", 
    "I use my electrophorus disk, and I'm going to hold my", 
    "electrophorus disk very close to one spout, temporarily", 
    "allowing it to polarize the water.", 
    "And once it starts, chances are that it will feed on", 
    "itself and go into the runaway.", 
    "It's not very predictable, but I will make an attempt.", 
    "So the first thing that I will have to do is-- maybe you can", 
    "zero the E field.", 
    "Yeah, thank you.", 
    "So the first thing I want to do is to make sure that if we", 
    "start running water now, that the system", 
    "doesn't start by itself.", 
    "Because then I can't be nice to the system anymore.", 
    "So let's just run some water.", 
    "I hope that Marcos brought it high enough.", 
    "And let's see.", 
    "And you can really tell by looking at the...", 
    "Oh, there are air bubbles in the system, I have to get rid", 
    "of the air bubbles.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So look at the electric field doing nothing.", 
    "System can't start.", 
    "A is desperately reaching out to this water, but", 
    "it's too far way.", 
    "It can't polarize it, and the battery can't get going.", 
    "Oh, aye, it does get going!", 
    "Oh, Marcos, we didn't bring it far enough.", 
    "You have to bring it higher.", 
    "Oh, by the way, this is interesting.", 
    "Let's see whether it actually-- oh boy, this is", 
    "incredible.", 
    "This is a distance of about 50 centimeters.", 
    "And look at it.", 
    "That is amazing.", 
    "The little sucker.", 
    "I had never expected that.", 
    "Let's give it a fair chance.", 
    "Let's give it a chance.", 
    "It's only reasonable.", 
    "Goes very slowly now.", 
    "You can see why it goes so slowly, because A very far", 
    "away from the spout.", 
    "But boy, and you can see the water.", 
    "The water is still pretty normal.", 
    "Oh, man.", 
    "This is almost cheating on me.", 
    "Uh oh.", 
    "Uh oh.", 
    "We have to raise it a little further after.", 
    "But I want to give it a chance to spark.", 
    "The two poles are close enough.", 
    "So it will probably get there.", 
    "Boy, this is almost torture for me.", 
    "Oh, look at that.", 
    "Look at that.", 
    "I begin to see the water already.", 
    "Look at the water.", 
    "It's already spreading.", 
    "Ah, there it is.", 
    "Marcos, can you run it even higher?", 
    "And then we'll see whether we can actually stop it", 
    "altogether, bring it a lot higher, and then we will make", 
    "an attempt to start it with some help from a friend.", 
    "You ready?", 
    "Oh man, I can hardly--", 
    "OK.", 
    "Don't tell me it can go into the--", 
    "it can go into the other direction, of course, because", 
    "it's a random choice that it has at the start.", 
    "Ah, ugh.", 
    "It's letting me down.", 
    "Let me see whether I can help it a little.", 
    "My electrophorus disk, I'm going to hold it here.", 
    "You know why I held it there?", 
    "Because I was hoping it would reverse the direction.", 
    "It doesn't even want to do that.", 
    "It's really recalcitrant today, isn't it?", 
    "Hold it here.", 
    "Negative charge.", 
    "The reason why you see the sudden change in the electric", 
    "field is because of the E field probe, which senses the", 
    "electrophorus disk when I held it near the spout above B. It", 
    "has decided, no matter what--", 
    "well, has it really?", 
    "Uh, uh, uh, has it really made any decision?", 
    "It's thinking now what it's going to do.", 
    "Oh, man.", 
    "Yeah!", 
    "It's going in the direction that I wanted it to go because", 
    "I held negative charge close to B, and I knew that would", 
    "force it into the direction that it's going now.", 
    "Oh, man!", 
    "Yeah!", 
    "Well, look, the distance is now-- what is it now?", 
    "Something like 80, 85 centimeters.", 
    "The system is desperate, but it's doing what", 
    "it's supposed to do.", 
    "Physics works again.", 
    "And we will get a spark because this is close enough.", 
    "Oh, boy, you got a lot for your money this time.", 
    "You really did, didn't you?", 
    "You saw for one thing that the system first started up going", 
    "in one direction, and later in the other because there was a", 
    "random charge which changed polarity, which is something", 
    "that we cannot always control.", 
    "But by holding this negatively charged disk close to the", 
    "spout above B, I forced the polarization in the way", 
    "that I wanted it.", 
    "And that's what you're seeing now.", 
    "We've got to give it a fair chance, and then", 
    "I'll give you a light.", 
    "And then you have four more minutes left to fill out the", 
    "evaluation.", 
    "But let's at least give this battery a charge", 
    "now to lay its egg.", 
    "The water still doesn't show much of a sign of spreading,", 
    "but I expect that that will happen very shortly because", 
    "we've seen this now before.", 
    "It's slowly increasing the charge on the cans A and B.", 
    "It's creeping so slowly that if we wait, you may never be", 
    "able to fill out your--", 
    "I'll give you a little light so you can fill out the", 
    "evaluation, and then we can still let it run", 
    "and see what happens.", 
    "So please leave the evaluations here as you leave.", 
    "And I will keep that going for some of you who have the", 
    "patience to see what will happen."
