    "WALTER LEWIN: And if I have blue light in my white light,", 
    "it will also have a maximum here that's non-negotiable.", 
    "But it has its first order maximum here because the", 
    "wavelength is shorter.", 
    "And it have its second order maximum here.", 
    "This will be the same distance.", 
    "And so when you do this with white flight, you're going to", 
    "see the always a zero order white light, because all the", 
    "colors have their maximum at zero order.", 
    "But at first and second the higher orders, the colors walk", 
    "at their own pace, so to speak.", 
    "And then the smaller the wavelength is, the closer it", 
    "will be to the zero order.", 
    "And then the spacings between first and second will also be", 
    "smaller that in the case of the long wavelengths,", 
    "in this case, red.", 
    "And this is something that I also want to", 
    "demonstrate to you.", 
    "Is not so easy to get a very strong, powerful source of", 
    "white light.", 
    "I'm using for this a reflection grating.", 
    "You can also use gratings in reflection.", 
    "You take metal and then the grooves are made on the metal", 
    "and you get a reflection, which we will have", 
    "there on the wall.", 
    "This reflection grating has a spacing which is four times", 
    "smaller than the one we have here.", 
    "So it's only 2.5 microns.", 
    "And so the angle theta 1 will not be 3.5 degrees, but it'll", 
    "be four times larger.", 
    "The main purpose why I want to show you this is I use white", 
    "light, that the zero order is white.", 
    "And then we will see also of course the first and the", 
    "second order if we have good eyes.", 
    "Because the whole thing is not so very bright.", 
    "Make sure that I have my lights, the flashlight.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "I don't even have to tell you what the zero order is, do I?", 
    "The zero order is the same location for all the colors.", 
    "So clearly this is the zero order.", 
    "You may be surprised at the zero order is so broad.", 
    "Why isn't it very narrow?", 
    "Because there are so many lines per inch.", 
    "The reason is, of course, that no matter how many lines per", 
    "inch you have, your spectrum will never be narrower than", 
    "the actual size of the light source itself.", 
    "And so the reason why this is as big as it is, is because", 
    "the light source is big.", 
    "So all the colors fall at the same", 
    "location at the zero order.", 
    "That's why you see white light.", 
    "Here is the first order spectrum.", 
    "Notice that the red is farther away from the zero", 
    "order than the blue.", 
    "Here is the first order on the other side.", 
    "Again, the red is further away from this zero", 
    "order then the blue.", 
    "And you can even see here the second order.", 
    "And again, the red is further away than the blue.", 
    "I now have a red laser which is pointing in exactly the", 
    "same direction as the white light.", 
    "And so I make a prediction now that the zero order of the red", 
    "laser must fall in here, that the first order of the red", 
    "laser must fall here in the red, that the first order of", 
    "the red laser must fall here in the red, and it must fall", 
    "here in the red of the second order.", 
    "So I'm going to turn on the laser, if", 
    "you're a little patient.", 
    "There it is, exactly as predicted.", 
    "Notice that the red laser always falls at the location", 
    "where the white light has the red in its spectrum.", 
    "And that's what you expect, of course.", 
    "And the zero order is right here.", 
    "There is actually a much better way that I can make you", 
    "see all this.", 
    "And that is if I ask you-- which I think", 
    "I'm going to do now--", 
    "to use your grating.", 
    "But hold it for a second before you get your own", 
    "gratings out.", 
    "Our equations that we have we have derived so far only hold", 
    "if we look very far away.", 
    "These angles of theta are only true if you go very far away.", 
    "For reasons that we discussed last time, we can however do", 
    "something very clever.", 
    "We can use a lens.", 
    "And if we have a lens, we can bring the image very close", 
    "without disturbing the angles.", 
    "If this is a grating, this is the number of", 
    "sources that I have.", 
    "And so the light comes in this direction.", 
    "And if I put here a lens.", 
    "And this is the screen, the focal point of the lens.", 
    "Then if the angle theta for which I would have expected,", 
    "in this direction, my first order maximum, and here, of", 
    "course, my zero order maximum, then the lens will not change", 
    "that angle.", 
    "We never discussed lenses, so it may not be so obvious to", 
    "you, but the lens will always maintain the", 
    "integrity of angles.", 
    "So the angle theta that we derived here is the correct", 
    "angle, but of course in terms of x, that is enormously", 
    "reduced if this distance is very small.", 
    "So then we have the option that we don't have to allow", 
    "for very large distances, like now 10 meters.", 
    "And so your eye is a perfect tool to use for that because", 
    "you have a lens in your eye.", 
    "That's the whole idea.", 
    "And so now I want you do get your gratings out.", 
    "And I want you to hold the gratings in front of your eyes", 
    "and manipulate the gratings a little bit so you get the", 
    "lines vertical.", 
    "And you will easily be able to do that.", 
    "This is your light source.", 
    "Your gratings have 10,000 lines per millimeter.", 
    "That means the spacing of you're grating is one micron.", 
    "One micron is 10 times smaller than this number.", 
    "So the angles are huge in your case.", 
    "They're way larger than what we have there.", 
    "I will make it completely dark.", 
    "And then I want you to rotate your grating such that you get", 
    "the spectra on either side, on the left and on the right.", 
    "That means your groove are then in vertical direction.", 
    "And what you see now way better than what I could show", 
    "you my previous demonstration, you see the zero order is the", 
    "lamp itself.", 
    "All the colors are right at the center.", 
    "That's the lamp.", 
    "That's your zero order maximum.", 
    "And then you see, if you go to the right, you see the blue", 
    "coming in beautifully first, because that's the smallest", 
    "wavelength.", 
    "You're going further to the right.", 
    "You see the first order red.", 
    "You're Going further to the right.", 
    "You see the second order blue.", 
    "You go further to the right, and you see second order red.", 
    "But since d is so amazingly small in your case, there may", 
    "not be too many maxima in the red.", 
    "In fact, I will ask you on one of the homework assignments,", 
    "which is the optional one, how many maxima in the", 
    "red you will see.", 
    "So the essential here is that you see that the zero order", 
    "maximum at the center is white light.", 
    "And it's not until you get to first and second order that", 
    "you begin to see the colors separate.", 
    "Now these gratings can be used to do atomic physics.", 
    "There are atoms and molecules which emit very discrete", 
    "frequencies, very discrete wavelengths.", 
    "And when you look at them with a grating, you can see very", 
    "distinctly where these lines fall, where", 
    "these wavelengths fall.", 
    "And that's the next thing that I want to do.", 
    "I will show you.", 
    "Now I will turn off the white light source.", 
    "And I will turn on for you neon.", 
    "And so I want you to look now at the neon.", 
    "And if you give yourself some time, you will see that the", 
    "neon is not a continuous spectrum like you saw with the", 
    "white light bulb, but you see very distinct locations where", 
    "you see maxima.", 
    "You see many in the red.", 
    "And I think you see several in the orange.", 
    "And I noticed this morning that I see two", 
    "lines in the green.", 
    "You have to look very carefully because these lines", 
    "in the green are very faint.", 
    "And so the whole purpose then is that with these gratings,", 
    "you can not only find out which wavelengths are emitted", 
    "by these atoms in these molecules, but you can also", 
    "find the relative strength.", 
    "And that is of course, entering the", 
    "domain of atomic physics.", 
    "And these gratings are extremely powerful to do that.", 
    "And I would advise you to carry these gratings with you", 
    "at least for the next few weeks.", 
    "And when you're outside and you get a chance to see some", 
    "bright lights out on highways or on the street, to look", 
    "through the grating and see whether you can see these", 
    "emission lines.", 
    "Mercury, if you get mercury lamps,", 
    "they are very beautiful.", 
    "You see many, many different color.", 
    "Very discrete frequencies, very discrete wavelengths are", 
    "emitted by mercury in the same way, the same kind of physics", 
    "that you see here with neon.", 
    "So now comes something that may come as a surprise to you,", 
    "because now I would like to discuss with you the", 
    "interference pattern if we have only one slit.", 
    "We discussed two.", 
    "We discussed capital N as a large number.", 
    "But what now if we have only one slit?", 
    "Even if you have only one slit, there will be directions", 
    "in space whereby light plus light gives darkness and there", 
    "will be directions whereby the light constructively", 
    "interferes with each other.", 
    "And strangely enough, this is given a different name.", 
    "We call this diffraction.", 
    "It's exactly the same physics.", 
    "There is no difference.", 
    "It should've been called interference, but in the", 
    "literature, you will see it under the name diffraction.", 
    "It all comes down again, to Huygens's principle.", 
    "So let me here now have a single opening.", 
    "And this opening is a slit perpendicular to the", 
    "blackboard.", 
    "And the opening is a in size.", 
    "A single one.", 
    "And the plane waves come in.", 
    "And Mr. Huygens says that all these sources here are all", 
    "going to be emitting the lights at the same frequency,", 
    "the same wavelengths, and they will all be in", 
    "phase with each other.", 
    "Because these plane waves arrive here", 
    "all at the same time.", 
    "And so I could now ask myself the question, at what angle of", 
    "theta will I see maximum?", 
    "At what angle of theta will I see minimum?", 
    "And you can also put a screen then at large distance l.", 
    "You can call x equals zero here.", 
    "And you can ask yourself, where will I see these maxima", 
    "and where will I see these minima?", 
    "To derive this, in this case, is not easy.", 
    "Again, I refer to 8.03.", 
    "It's as difficult as deriving, in this case, this whole", 
    "structure in between the maxima.", 
    "One thing is obvious.", 
    "And that is that you've got to get a maximum that is non", 
    "negotiable when theta equals zero.", 
    "That's simply a matter of symmetry of the problem.", 
    "If all these sources are in phase clearly you're going to", 
    "get a maximum here.", 
    "No one will question that.", 
    "The minima is very tricky.", 
    "And the minima will fall at the following locations, the", 
    "sine of theta of n equals n times lambda divided by a.", 
    "And for small angle approximation, this is the", 
    "same as theta n in radians.", 
    "And when you see that equation, you're first", 
    "reaction should be that maybe I goofed by a factor of two.", 
    "Because your first reaction will be, that's the same", 
    "equation that we have there.", 
    "And then we have d there.", 
    "And so how can we have minimum here where", 
    "we have maxima there?", 
    "Well, the situation is different.", 
    "The best way that you can see that that equation is not", 
    "wrong is perhaps the following.", 
    "Suppose you take the angle theta 1.", 
    "So that's for n equals 1.", 
    "Then the relation that you see there will tell you that this", 
    "source here, this Huygens source and this Huygens source", 
    "have a difference in path lengths of lambda", 
    "And so you will then say, aha, that's constructive", 
    "interference.", 
    "That's true.", 
    "But that means this Huygens source and this Huygens source", 
    "will then have a difference in path of half of lambda, so", 
    "they will kill each other.", 
    "And that means this Huygens source and this Huygens source", 
    "will have a difference in path length of 1/2 lambda, so they", 
    "will also kill each other.", 
    "And so, in this upper half, there's always one Huygens", 
    "source which will kill the one at the bottom.", 
    "And you can do a similar reasoning for", 
    "the angle theta 2.", 
    "And so that is indeed the correct equation.", 
    "You will find complete minima when theta 1 in terms of", 
    "radians is lambda divided by a, and theta 2 is 2 lambda", 
    "divided by a, and so on.", 
    "That's where you find you minima.", 
    "And if you convert that into x where they actually fall on", 
    "the screen, well, then x1 will be for small angle", 
    "approximations, L times lambda divided by a.", 
    "That's no different.", 
    "And so now what I owe you is a pattern.", 
    "What will the pattern look like?", 
    "When I look on the screen there, what will I really see?", 
    "Well, it's going to look very different from", 
    "what you may think.", 
    "I will plot it now in terms of x.", 
    "I could have plotted it in terms of theta, but I decided", 
    "to plot it in terms of x.", 
    "So here at x equals zero, there is unmistakable,", 
    "unnegotiable that it is a maximum that coincides with", 
    "theta equals zero.", 
    "And then here at lambda divided by a, completely", 
    "destructive interference.", 
    "That's that angle, theta 1 times L. And then here, L 2", 
    "lambda divided by a, complete destructive interference.", 
    "And the same is true, of course, on the other side.", 
    "And what you're going to see now in terms of the intensity", 
    "that I showed you there, watts per square meters, is a curve", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "It's got an enormously broad maximum, absolutely zero here,", 
    "very small maximum, absolutely zero there, very small", 
    "maximum, and zero there.", 
    "And this continues for a long time.", 
    "And this is very different from anything we've seen with", 
    "multiple sources.", 
    "If the intensity here is I zero, then the maximum here--", 
    "which I didn't even calculate where it is.", 
    "It is somewhere in between these two minima, but I didn't", 
    "calculate precisely where it is.--", 
    "that maximum is very low.", 
    "It's only 4.5% in strength of I0.", 
    "And this is even lower.", 
    "This is only 1.6% of I0.", 
    "So when you look at a diffraction pattern-- we call", 
    "this a diffraction pattern like this--", 
    "you will see a very broad center maximum.", 
    "And then you see these dark spots on either side.", 
    "And you see light coming up again in between them, sort of", 
    "sub-maxima.", 
    "And so the width of this center maximum, this width,", 
    "which is really x1, that width is then L lambda divided by a.", 
    "And if you want to be picky, you say well, center maximum", 
    "is really twice that much.", 
    "Fine, be my guest.", 
    "But this is clearly a measure for how wide that center spot", 
    "will be when you see it on a screen.", 
    "And now there comes something that is completely not", 
    "intuitive for you as well as for me.", 
    "And that is if you make a very small,--", 
    "that means you let the light go through an", 
    "extremely narrow slit--", 
    "what you will see on the wall is extremely wide.", 
    "The smallest a is, the wider it will be.", 
    "It's exactly opposed to what you would predict.", 
    "You would think if you make opening through which you put", 
    "light very small, you would think that what you see on the", 
    "screen is also very small.", 
    "It's exactly the opposite.", 
    "And this is what I want to demonstrate to you.", 
    "I have here a demonstration with a variable slit.", 
    "I can vary a.", 
    "And we will use the brightest laser that we have, a beam of", 
    "green laser light, about 5,400 angstroms.", 
    "And what I will do is I will make this opening narrower,", 
    "and narrower, and narrower.", 
    "And as I make the opening--", 
    "I start very large.", 
    "I start with a large opening of maybe 5 millimeters.", 
    "At a large opening, a is so large that this", 
    "is negligible small.", 
    "Because a is very large, then this is not very large.", 
    "This is very small.", 
    "But as I make a smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and", 
    "smaller, there comes a time that the diffraction width is", 
    "going to be dominating the whole scene.", 
    "And what you will see then on the screen there that the", 
    "bright spot will get wider, wider, wider, wider.", 
    "And that for me, is always so enormously fascinating because", 
    "it goes so strongly against our intuition.", 
    "And so this is what I have next on the menu.", 
    "I have here this variable slit.", 
    "I must make sure that I have my flashlight.", 
    "And I'll turn on this laser that I earlier", 
    "accidentally turned on.", 
    "I hope it's coming on.", 
    "Yes, it is.", 
    "And so you see there the slit is now very wide.", 
    "And so the size of that slit that you see there--", 
    "or the size of the bright spot-- is now entirely", 
    "dictated by the divergence off my laser beam.", 
    "The diffraction width is negligibly small, because a is", 
    "very large.", 
    "But now watch.", 
    "Now I'm going to tighten to make a smaller.", 
    "And I'm doing that now.", 
    "I'm making it smaller and smaller.", 
    "The diffraction which is still negligible.", 
    "Making it smaller.", 
    "Ah.", 
    "I am beginning to see the dark lines.", 
    "Ah!", 
    "The diffraction is taking over.", 
    "Look at the center maximum, right there.", 
    "It's getting wider.", 
    "It's getting wider.", 
    "And I make the slit narrower.", 
    "It's getting wider.", 
    "It's getting wider.", 
    "And look how beautiful.", 
    "You see these destructive interferences, where plus", 
    "light gives darkness.", 
    "Wider, wider.", 
    "Right now it is at least 10 times", 
    "wider than it was before.", 
    "And now it is 20 times wider.", 
    "And it gets very faint.", 
    "Of course it gets very faint.", 
    "Because if I make the slit very narrow, not much light", 
    "goes through.", 
    "There's nothing I can do about it.", 
    "But notice how incredibly impressive this is.", 
    "How wide that center maximum becomes.", 
    "And that is very characteristic for", 
    "diffraction.", 
    "The narrower the slit, the wider the diffraction pattern", 
    "at the center maximum.", 
    "Now I did this in monochromatic light.", 
    "Monochromatic light means that you have practically only one", 
    "wavelength.", 
    "And there is a way that I can make you see this", 
    "from your own seats.", 
    "And that is what we're going to do with the", 
    "cards that you have.", 
    "So if you can get the cards out now.", 
    "We did this in one color, right?", 
    "In green light.", 
    "Almost one color, almost monochromatic.", 
    "So you see a beautiful pattern here, very well", 
    "defined dark lines.", 
    "You now can use this little slit that you have, put it in", 
    "front of your eye.", 
    "And I'm going to make you see this white light.", 
    "And you will see all the features that you are supposed", 
    "to see, but it's even more interesting in white light", 
    "because with white light, you have a little red, you have a", 
    "little blue, you have a little yellow.", 
    "And so these minima will fall at different", 
    "locations of course.", 
    "And so you don't see it as beautiful as I showed you.", 
    "As distinct as I showed you in green.", 
    "But you see very distinctly the center maximum and you see", 
    "the dark lines on either side.", 
    "But the main reason why I want you to see this is that if you", 
    "manage to manipulate the size of the slit, the size of a, if", 
    "you manage to manipulate that, when you make it narrower,", 
    "notice that the diffraction pattern gets broader and not", 
    "the other way around.", 
    "So first, make sure you get it, that you begin to see the", 
    "dark areas, and then try to make it a little narrower.", 
    "And then you see that it opens up, which is precisely what I", 
    "did with the variable slit here.", 
    "So give it a little bit of time.", 
    "What helps me is that actually you don't have to pull it", 
    "open, but yet you can move one piece of the card behind the", 
    "other card.", 
    "So your one thumb goes through the back and the other thumb", 
    "comes forward.", 
    "That works very well for me.", 
    "Who can see clearly the diffraction pattern", 
    "unmistakably?", 
    "Very good.", 
    "Take the card with you.", 
    "Impress your parents.", 
    "And look at home at very bright streetlights and you", 
    "will still see the same diffraction pattern, although", 
    "not as ideal as you see it here because our source is a", 
    "line source and that helps of course if", 
    "you slit is the vertical."
