    "WALTER LEWIN: So I should have negative charge on there now.",

    "Boy, there's charge.", 
    "There's no question.", 
    "We agree, right?", 
    "There's charge.", 
    "OK, now I touch the inside.", 
    "Let's hope that no sparks fly over.", 
    "I touch it, nothing.", 
    "See it?", 
    "Absolutely nothing.", 
    "So there's no charge inside.", 
    "The charge is on the outside, which is what I just", 
    "demonstrated.", 
    "So you see it in front of your own eyes.", 
    "All the charge goes to the outside.", 
    "Not so intuitive, but an immediate consequence of the", 
    "fact that it is a conductor, that the electrons will move", 
    "freely, so that the electric field in the", 
    "conductor itself is 0.", 
    "And we have argued that no charge can ever go on the", 
    "inside of the surface.", 
    "It all stays on the outside.", 
    "So when I touched the inside, there was no charge.", 
    "So if you are inside that conductor, if your house is a", 
    "conducting house, and someone in the outside world charges", 
    "your house up, when you're inside, you have no", 
    "knowledge of that.", 
    "That's quite amazing, isn't it?", 
    "You are electrically shielded from the outside world.", 
    "Now I'm going to make the situation even more", 
    "complicated.", 
    "I now take a conducting object.", 
    "Doesn't have to be a sphere.", 
    "And I bring that conducting object --hollow--", 
    "in an external electric field.", 
    "So someone outside your house is turning on a Van de Graaff,", 
    "creating an electric field.", 
    "Well, now what's going to happen?", 
    "Well, due to induction, you're going to get some charge", 
    "polarization in the conductor.", 
    "One side may end up negative, and the other", 
    "side may end up positive.", 
    "But what happens on the insides?", 
    "Nothing.", 
    "The electric field in the conductor must stay everywhere", 
    "zero if it is a static electric field.", 
    "And so no charge can accumulate here, and no charge", 
    "can accumulate on the inside.", 
    "And so as you bring this electric field on the outside,", 
    "you may get negative and positive", 
    "charge on the outside.", 
    "Maybe negative here and positive", 
    "there, but inside, nothing.", 
    "You are inside, electrically shielded", 
    "from the outside world.", 
    "In the same way that you were when someone was trying to put", 
    "a charge on your house, now someone is trying to zap you", 
    "with electric fields.", 
    "Nothing will happen inside.", 
    "You will never see an electric field inside.", 
    "I will show you an interesting drawing, interesting figure,", 
    "which is a conducting box.", 
    "It's closed.", 
    "The cut that you see opens it just to allow you to look", 
    "inside, but it is closed from all sides.", 
    "And there are some negative charges here.", 
    "And there are positive charges in the foreground,", 
    "which you don't see.", 
    "The red field lines come from positive charges,", 
    "end up on the box.", 
    "And the negative field lines go from the box to the", 
    "negative charges.", 
    "There is clear polarization.", 
    "The box itself is neutral.", 
    "I started with a neutral box.", 
    "But because of this electric field, I get polarization.", 
    "I end up with negative charge on the box", 
    "here, only on the outside.", 
    "Positive charge on the box here, only on the outside.", 
    "Inside, electric field is 0.", 
    "No charge anywhere inside.", 
    "Due to this crazy electric field, the free moving charges", 
    "in the conductor will rearrange themselves in such a", 
    "way that the electric field is 0 everywhere in the conductor.", 
    "It's 0 inside the cavity, and that the closed loop integral", 
    "of E dot dl is 0 everywhere, if these are static fields.", 
    "And it is clearly impossible for us to ever calculate how", 
    "that charge configuration at the surface will have to be in", 
    "order to meet all those conditions.", 
    "But nature can do this effortlessly.", 
    "And it can do it extremely fast, obeying", 
    "all the laws of physics.", 
    "It puts very quickly plus charge here, and", 
    "minus charge there.", 
    "Makes sure that there's no charge on the", 
    "inside of the surface.", 
    "It makes sure that the electric field is everywhere 0", 
    "inside and in the box, and it also makes sure that the", 
    "closed loop integral of E dot dl must be 0 everywhere.", 
    "And therefore the box and everything inside becomes an", 
    "equipotential, so it also arranges matters so that the", 
    "field lines, wherever they intersect with the box, are", 
    "always perpendicular to the box.", 
    "And all of that is done in almost no", 
    "time at all by nature.", 
    "It is an amazing thing that this happens, and something", 
    "that, as I said, would be impossible for us to", 
    "calculate, because the field configurations are", 
    "extraordinarily difficult.", 
    "So if you were inside this metal box, no matter what", 
    "happens on the outside, you would be electrically isolated", 
    "from the outside world.", 
    "You would not notice that there is a strong electric", 
    "field outside, nor would you notice that people are trying", 
    "to charge up your house.", 
    "We call that electrostatic shielding, and", 
    "we give that a name.", 
    "That house of yours would be called a Faraday cage.", 
    "It's called after the great physicist Faraday.", 
    "You will learn a lot more about him during this course.", 
    "Before I demonstrate this, I want to address an issue which", 
    "is related to problem 2-1, which is your next assignment.", 
    "And I want to urge you, I make myself no illusion, but I want", 
    "to urge you to start working on that assignment this", 
    "weekend, not next week.", 
    "These assignments are not just baby assignments.", 
    "These are MIT assignments, and you've got to put in a lot of", 
    "work to do them.", 
    "So please start this weekend, not to do me a favor, but to", 
    "do yourself that favor.", 
    "But let's talk about problem 2-1.", 
    "In other words, I will help you with that problem 2-1.", 
    "I said several times that it is not possible to get an", 
    "electric field inside a hollow conductor.", 
    "Well, suppose I go inside the conductor.", 
    "I go inside there, and I put, sneakily, a", 
    "charge in my pocket.", 
    "And I sit inside there, and you close it.", 
    "That there is a charge inside, there's nothing you", 
    "can do about it.", 
    "And if there's a charge inside,", 
    "there's an electric field.", 
    "So now we have a situation, and since it is post", 
    "Valentine's Day, my heart has evolved into a sphere again.", 
    "So now we take a spherical conductor, solid, this is", 
    "solid material.", 
    "And somehow I'm sitting inside here with a charge +q.", 
    "We can make it minus if you want, but that's exactly what", 
    "problem 2-1 is about.", 
    "And now clearly, there is positive charge inside.", 
    "So clearly there has to be an electric field.", 
    "But the electric field inside a conductor, that means the", 
    "electric field anywhere here must be 0.", 
    "If it's not 0, the electrons will keep", 
    "moving until it is 0.", 
    "So the conducting material itself has no electric fields."
