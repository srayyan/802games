    "by the current 4.5.", 
    "And when I do that, I find about 0.026 tesla.", 
    "0.026 tesla, that is about 260 gauss.", 
    "And when we do the experiment, the current", 
    "will be a little different.", 
    "But you will see that indeed the field will be very close", 
    "to 260 gauss.", 
    "Why is it that the magnetic field is not proportional to", 
    "the number of loops, but proportional to the number of", 
    "loops per unit length?", 
    "You may say, well, if I have one loop, I have a certain", 
    "magnetic field.", 
    "Two loops, I have twice that magnetic field.", 
    "10 loops, I have 10 times that magnetic field.", 
    "Well, imagine that we start a solenoid in Lobby 7.", 
    "And so here's Lobby 7.", 
    "And here is that solenoid.", 
    "There it goes, all the way, all the way, thousands and", 
    "thousands and thousands and thousands of loops.", 
    "And we end up here in 26-100.", 
    "Look at this loop.", 
    "Think of this as the first loop,", 
    "creates a magnetic field.", 
    "What is the shape of that magnetic field?", 
    "Well, it is a current loop.", 
    "And as we discussed last time, the magnetic field that one", 
    "loop produces is like a dipole field.", 
    "So do you really think that here in 26-100, we can sense", 
    "the magnetic field that is produced by this", 
    "one dinky toy loop?", 
    "Practically nothing.", 
    "It falls off so rapidly, the magnetic field, that we don't", 
    "notice it here.", 
    "So it's immediately obvious that the magnetic field is not", 
    "proportional to how many loops you have.", 
    "If, however, you put all those loops on top of each other,", 
    "then of course you can add the magnetic fields.", 
    "And so it is natural that you get how many windings you have", 
    "per unit length.", 
    "So now I want to first show you the magnetic field", 
    "configuration of a very loosely", 
    "wound loop, 7 windings.", 
    "And I will do that by sprinkling magnetites, these", 
    "iron files, in the vicinity.", 
    "We've done this before for other current configurations.", 
    "Now we'll do it for this solenoid with 7 windings.", 
    "And I'm going to run a few hundred amperes through there.", 
    "But first get this car battery.", 
    "All right.", 
    "And so we put some iron files on here.", 
    "And what I want you to see now is that the magnetic field", 
    "inside, even though it's very loosely wound, begins to look", 
    "nicely uniform, and that there's almost no magnetic", 
    "field outside.", 
    "Look at this.", 
    "Isn't that wonderful?", 
    "Isn't that incredible?", 
    "You see how these iron files line themselves up very nicely", 
    "horizontally inside the loops.", 
    "And when you look outside the loop here or there, where we", 
    "assume the magnetic field was about zero, you don't see the", 
    "iron files being oriented in any preferred direction, which", 
    "indicates that the magnetic field is very low.", 
    "Now, I want to show you what magnetic field we can get with", 
    "this baby, which is exactly what I had here on the", 
    "blackboard.", 
    "It has 2,800 windings, and we're going to run a current", 
    "which is something like 4.5 amperes, but I'm going to tell", 
    "you what that current is because I have a current meter", 
    "there for you, and I also have a meter which indicates the", 
    "magnetic field.", 
    "The lower one is the current meter.", 
    "And the maximum current that you see there-- at the 3--", 
    "would be six amperes.", 
    "And the upper one is calibrated in such a way that", 
    "if it is full scale, you would have 300 gauss.", 
    "So with 3, it's 300 gauss.", 
    "And I have a probe, a magnetic probe.", 
    "We never discussed how that works.", 
    "We call it a Hall probe.", 
    "And this Hall probe allows me to measure the magnetic field", 
    "in the vicinity of the solenoid.", 
    "It's even sign sensitive.", 
    "If the magnetic field is like this, it will go to the right.", 
    "If the magnetic field is like this, it will go to the left.", 
    "And so this allows us then to be actually quite quantitative", 
    "and evaluate the magnetic field near the", 
    "opening of the solenoid.", 
    "Then we can go in there, and we could", 
    "also probe the outside.", 
    "So I'm running now a current.", 
    "Let's look at it.", 
    "That's the bottom meter.", 
    "So that is about 4.8 amperes.", 
    "I assumed it was 4.5.", 
    "It's a little higher.", 
    "And here comes this probe.", 
    "And I am now about a foot away from the", 
    "entrance, and you see nothing.", 
    "And I come closer to the entrance, and the magnetic", 
    "field begins to show.", 
    "Nowhere nearly constant yet.", 
    "I'm now entering.", 
    "100 gauss.", 
    "I'm going in deeper.", 
    "200 gauss.", 
    "Even deeper and deeper.", 
    "And now I have about 240 gauss.", 
    "And notice, as I go in farther, it doesn't increase.", 
    "It's more or less constant.", 
    "Amazing!", 
    "That it's more or less constant.", 
    "And when I come out here, I move it back and forth about", 
    "20 centimeters.", 
    "If I came in from the other side, you would simply see a", 
    "reversal in the sign, which is not so interesting.", 
    "So you see 240 gauss with the other direction because this", 
    "probe is sign sensitive.", 
    "I can now also show you that if I come on the outside of", 
    "the solenoid, you see nothing.", 
    "So indeed, our assumption that the magnetic field is very low", 
    "outside a tightly wound solenoid was a very good", 
    "assumption.", 
    "Very well.", 
    "You've been asked--", 
    "and the deadline is Friday, 4:00 PM--", 
    "to explain the behavior of the Kelvin water dropper.", 
    "And I decided to give you a little bit of help on that.", 
    "Most of you may already have figured it out, but those who", 
    "haven't probably won't figure it out between", 
    "now and Friday anyhow.", 
    "So I might as well tell you.", 
    "That water dropper, called the Kelvin water dropper, is an", 
    "amazing battery.", 
    "We've seen it before.", 
    "We know what it's doing.", 
    "But I will go over that again.", 
    "We have here buckets A and B. Water comes down from above.", 
    "Water run through.", 
    "You see the water there runs out.", 
    "And we collect these water drops here in", 
    "bucket D. It's a conductor.", 
    "And this water is collected in bucket", 
    "C. It's also a conductor.", 
    "And the paint can A is connected", 
    "to C. That's crucial.", 
    "And the paint can B is connected with D. And here", 
    "there are two balls which I can bring close together.", 
    "I run water, and after a while, I see a spark here.", 
    "I can even see a spark when the distance is something like", 
    "six millimeters, which would be about potential difference", 
    "of about 20 kilovolts.", 
    "How does it work?", 
    "Well, water has a pH of 7.", 
    "That means one in 10 to the 7 molecules is ionized.", 
    "So I have OH minus, and I have H plus.", 
    "And those are going to be the current carriers.", 
    "The ions are doing the work here, are doing their job.", 
    "Let's make an enlargement here of can A. And can A, let us", 
    "assume that purely by chance, it has a little bit of", 
    "positive charge on it.", 
    "It could be negative, but I'll just assume it's", 
    "positive for now.", 
    "In either case, it will work.", 
    "You will see.", 
    "Just by chance, like you have a little bit of net charge.", 
    "You're not completely neutral.", 
    "And so this can has a little bit of positive extra charge.", 
    "And now here is the drop from the spout.", 
    "What's going to happen?", 
    "Through induction, through polarization, you get a little", 
    "bit of excess negative charge here and a little bit of", 
    "excess positive there because the positives repel each", 
    "other, and the negative is being attracted.", 
    "So H plus goes a little bit up, and the OH minus comes a", 
    "little bit down.", 
    "But now the drop breaks, and there goes the drop.", 
    "So it's a little bit negative.", 
    "So now a little bit of negative drops come down, and", 
    "so this becomes negative.", 
    "But this is connected with B, so B becomes negative.", 
    "But what do you think is going to happen now with the drops", 
    "that fall through B?", 
    "They're going to become positive.", 
    "Because if B is negative, then of course", 
    "this will be reversed.", 
    "The bottom will be positive.", 
    "The top will be negative.", 
    "And so those drops now that are going to fall through are", 
    "going to be positive.", 
    "So C becomes positive.", 
    "But C is connected with A. So A becomes more positive.", 
    "And so A can do even a better job now on these water drops", 
    "and polarize them even more.", 
    "And so you get a runaway process.", 
    "And the whole system feeds on itself until the potential", 
    "difference here becomes so high that you exceed three", 
    "million volts per meter.", 
    "And then you get a break down, and you see a spark.", 
    "Now you can think of a continuous stream of water as", 
    "a stream of individual drops.", 
    "So it also works if you just have a regular stream of water", 
    "going down.", 
    "Who is doing the work here?", 
    "Someone has to do the work.", 
    "You have a battery.", 
    "The battery is being charged, and then it is discharged", 
    "through the spark.", 
    "Who's doing the work?", 
    "Any idea?", 
    "Have you thought about that?", 
    "Yeah?", 
    "Gravity.", 
    "Very good.", 
    "It's gravity that is doing the work.", 
    "We can see that very easily by identifying the current that", 
    "is flowing and the electric field.", 
    "How is the current flowing?", 
    "If negative charge is going down, would we all agree that", 
    "the current is going up?", 
    "If positive charge is going down, do we agree that the", 
    "current is going down?", 
    "This side of the spout here will be slightly positive, and", 
    "this is slightly negative because the H plus is more", 
    "abundant here than there.", 
    "And so we're going to get a current through the water in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "The water has a low but sufficient conductivity", 
    "because it's ionized one out of 10 to the 7 molecules.", 
    "And so once in awhile, if you see a spark here, then you get", 
    "a current there.", 
    "But it's intermittent, of course.", 
    "How about the electric fields?", 
    "Well, electric fields we know go from plus to minus.", 
    "So that's easy.", 
    "We could put the electric fields just in like that.", 
    "Electric field must here be in this direction.", 
    "Electric field here goes from plus to minus.", 
    "C is plus charged.", 
    "B is minus charged.", 
    "And so the electric field is in this direction.", 
    "Electric field is from plus to minus.", 
    "This is plus.", 
    "This is minus.", 
    "So the electric field is in this direction.", 
    "Electric field is from plus to minus.", 
    "The can A was positive, remember.", 
    "So the electric field is from plus to minus.", 
    "So that's the electric field configuration.", 
    "But now look what's happening.", 
    "Here, the E field and the current", 
    "are in the same direction.", 
    "That's fine.", 
    "Here, the E field and the current are", 
    "also in the same direction.", 
    "That's great.", 
    "But now, look at these poor negative ions.", 
    "These negative ions don't want to go in the direction of E.", 
    "Negative charge wants to go against the direction of E.", 
    "But gravity says, sorry, you can't do it.", 
    "I force you down.", 
    "And so these negative drops are forced by", 
    "gravity to go down.", 
    "Look at this positive charge.", 
    "These poor water drops, which are positively charged, go", 
    "against the electric field.", 
    "They don't want that.", 
    "Positive charges want to go with the electric field.", 
    "Gravity says, sorry.", 
    "It's too bad.", 
    "I force you down.", 
    "And so gravity is doing the work, so to speak, against the", 
    "will of the charges.", 
    "And then the battery charges up and charges up until the", 
    "potential difference becomes so high there that you see a", 
    "spark, and you deal with potential differences of", 
    "something like 20 kilovolts.", 
    "Remember last time, and you will see that again today,", 
    "that as the water goes through and as the system charges up,", 
    "that you begin to see that the water which starts running", 
    "like so begins to spread out.", 
    "It fans out.", 
    "You could hear it by changing the sound, but you", 
    "can also see it.", 
    "And I'll make you see it again today.", 
    "Why is that?"
