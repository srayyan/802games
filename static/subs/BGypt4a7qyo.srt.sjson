    "WALTER LEWIN: And the sun is a really powerful light bulb, 3", 
    "times 10 to the 26 watts, radiates largely visible light", 
    "and infrared radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "And we are at a distance of 150 million kilometers here,", 
    "somewhere on Earth.", 
    "And therefore, through every square meter, in the direction", 
    "perpendicular to the line of sight of the sun, through", 
    "every square meter, there's about one kilowatt flowing,", 
    "one kilowatt per square meter.", 
    "And you could calculate that at home to verify that.", 
    "That's easy calculation.", 
    "You know that it is 3 times 10 to the 26 joules per second.", 
    "And if the distance is 150 million kilometers, you can", 
    "calculate how much of that power will flow through one", 
    "square meter.", 
    "And that's very close to one kilowatt.", 
    "And we will call that, nevertheless, even though it's", 
    "not really a plane wave solution in that sense, we", 
    "will call that nevertheless the Poynting vector.", 
    "And I really don't care whether you think of this as", 
    "being a plane electromagnetic wave or whether you think of", 
    "it as more like spherical waves, as you see there.", 
    "Or even if you want to think of them as individual photons.", 
    "And I will come back to the photons.", 
    "As far as I'm concerned, it's all of the above.", 
    "But the result is that there's an energy flux every square", 
    "meter aimed in the direction of the sun.", 
    "1,000 joules per second will flow through that.", 
    "If you want to hang onto the plane wave solution, and if", 
    "you want to put any value at the plane wave solution, then", 
    "you have to draw the consequence that you can", 
    "calculate then the E 0 of that plane wave.", 
    "And I really don't know how meaningful that is.", 
    "But you would then get the equation that 1,000--", 
    "that is the average value of the Poynting", 
    "vector, that's a given--", 
    "is then E 0 squared divided by 2 mu 0 c We derive that there.", 
    "And so you can calculate now what E 0 is, and you'll find", 
    "that E 0 is approximately 870 volts per meter.", 
    "To be frank with you, I don't quite know what to do with", 
    "that number.", 
    "It is some equivalent electric field.", 
    "But it's really not the electric field, of course,", 
    "that you could measure because it's not really a plane wave", 
    "in the sense that we derived our Poynting vector for the", 
    "plane wave solutions.", 
    "So the bizarre thing is that in physics, you can think of", 
    "light, for instance, as a plane wave.", 
    "You can think of it as spherical waves.", 
    "You can think of it as photons.", 
    "And you can choose whichever fits you best to explain a", 
    "certain phenomenon.", 
    "And it is only in quantum mechanics where the wave and", 
    "the photon picture merge.", 
    "Let's talk about photons now.", 
    "That is one aspect of the electromagnetic waves, then.", 
    "Photons are really individual packages, wave trains.", 
    "You can think of them as bullets,", 
    "well-defined in time and space.", 
    "Wsh, there goes a photon.", 
    "That photon has a certain energy, which it", 
    "carries with it.", 
    "That means it has a certain momentum.", 
    "And the momentum of a photon, which comes from one of the", 
    "great works by Albert Einstein, the momentum a", 
    "photon, p, is the energy of one photon divided by c.", 
    "You just have to take my word for that.", 
    "If you ever take special relativity, you will", 
    "understand this a little better.", 
    "But given that, take it now, face value.", 
    "And now, if I shoot many photons at a target, and these", 
    "photons, if they are absorbed by that target, then the", 
    "target will experience a force.", 
    "Because if the photons carry momentum, and if the momentum", 
    "photon, photon, photon, photon,", 
    "photon, I feel a force.", 
    "You remember from 8.01, a force is dp/dt, is the", 
    "transfer of momentum.", 
    "If I throw rotten tomatoes at you, then when you get these", 
    "tomatoes on your face, they hit you like this, and then", 
    "they go, pbth, like this.", 
    "So they come in in a certain direction, and they lose all", 
    "their momentum in that direction.", 
    "That gives you force on you in this direction.", 
    "Because that momentum in this direction is destroyed, but", 
    "momentum is conserved, and so you get that momentum.", 
    "If, for instance, I threw one kilogram tomatoes at you each", 
    "second, so one after another, or average time average one", 
    "kilogram per second, and if each tomato had a speed of 5", 
    "meters per second, and I call that the x direction, and", 
    "here's your face, they hit your face, and then they go,", 
    "pbth, down.", 
    "So all the momentum in the x direction is destroyed.", 
    "Then you will experience a force in that x direction.", 
    "It's in the x direction, which is 1 times", 
    "5, which is 5 newtons.", 
    "It's a time average force.", 
    "If, for some reason, the tomatoes would bounce back,", 
    "there's a perfect elastic collision like tennis balls", 
    "would do, then the momentum transfer is twice.", 
    "Comes in with one momentum, and comes back.", 
    "So now the momentum transfer is twice this number.", 
    "It's not just destroyed, no.", 
    "It's reversed.", 
    "So in that case, the force on your face", 
    "would be double that.", 
    "It would be 10 newtons.", 
    "And so we can now carry this further to our electromagnetic", 
    "radiation, and we can return to our Poynting vector.", 
    "Here I have one square meter.", 
    "The radiation is coming in.", 
    "And I know exactly how much radiation is coming in.", 
    "For every square meter, there is this value, S. So S, which", 
    "is an energy, per square meter per second.", 
    "Remember, that's the dimension of the Poynting vector.", 
    "If I divide this by c, and I divide this by c, then look", 
    "what I have here.", 
    "I have energy divided by c.", 
    "But the energy in electromagnetic radiation", 
    "divided by c, according to Einstein, is momentum.", 
    "And I don't care whether this is 100 billions", 
    "of individual photons.", 
    "That's OK with me.", 
    "That is a momentum.", 
    "And so I have now a momentum per unit time.", 
    "That makes it a force.", 
    "But a force per square meter makes it a pressure.", 
    "And so this is pressure.", 
    "And we call that radiation pressure.", 
    "It means that if you are exposed to a bombardment of", 
    "electromagnetic radiation, and you absorb it,", 
    "that you feel a pressure.", 
    "The radiation comes to you, and you're", 
    "being pushed backwards.", 
    "And this is the pressure that you will experience.", 
    "It makes a difference whether the radiation is absorbed or", 
    "whether you are capable of reflecting that radiation,", 
    "just like with the tomatoes.", 
    "And so if I'm trying to be as general as I can, let me first", 
    "of all specify the mean value of S. That's the only thing in", 
    "electromagnetic radiation which matters.", 
    "It's the mean value.", 
    "So the mean value, then, if I divide that by c, and I", 
    "multiply that by a factor alpha, you'll come up shortly", 
    "and tell you what alpha is, that is now", 
    "the radiation pressure.", 
    "And alpha, if alpha is 1, then I have full absorption.", 
    "All the radiation is absorbed.", 
    "If there's no absorption, if it's completely transparent,", 
    "and there is some radiation that goes straight through", 
    "you, then alpha is 0.", 
    "But if there's 100% reflection, which can happen.", 
    "You can reflect radio waves from metals with almost 100%", 
    "reflection, then alpha is 2.", 
    "So you get twice the pressure.", 
    "If you take the sun, whereby the mean value for S is 1,000,", 
    "you can calculate now if you absorb that radiation over one", 
    "square meter, what the pressure would be that you", 
    "would experience.", 
    "So your body, one square meter.", 
    "You expose it to the sun, in the direction of the sun.", 
    "That force is insignificantly small.", 
    "The pressure would only be 3 times 10 to the -6 newtons per", 
    "square meter.", 
    "Because you have to divide that number, 1,000, by c.", 
    "There's not much left over.", 
    "And if you hold your hand up in the direction of the sun,", 
    "your hand would only have an area maybe of 1/100 of a", 
    "square meter.", 
    "That force is unnoticeable.", 
    "So in our daily lives, we don't experience radiation", 
    "pressure very much."
