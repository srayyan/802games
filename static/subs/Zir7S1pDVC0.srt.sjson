    "WALTER LEWIN: Resonance can be destructive.", 
    "Imagine if you have a very high Q system, if you're", 
    "slightly off resonance, it's almost no current.", 
    "No power dissipated in your resistor.", 
    "And now you come all of a sudden on the resonance, you", 
    "get an enormous current.", 
    "And that means there's an enormous power dissipation in", 
    "your resistor, and you can burn out your resistor.", 
    "You can destroy your circuits if you're not careful.", 
    "And next lecture and Monday, I will also discuss with you", 
    "some mechanical resonances.", 
    "Mechanical systems can also go into resonance.", 
    "They can also be destructive.", 
    "At certain frequencies, the systems behave--", 
    "call it violently.", 
    "They respond extremely strongly to their input", 
    "frequency, and things can break.", 
    "Humans have also resonance frequencies.", 
    "You can call them if you want, emotional resonances.", 
    "Or have sensitive nerves.", 
    "Someone makes a particular remark, go through the roof.", 
    "Also falling in love, when you think about it, is a resonance", 
    "phenomenon.", 
    "And that, too, can be rather destructive.", 
    "As many of us know.", 
    "So now, I would like to demonstrate to you the", 
    "resonance curves.", 
    "I'm going to choose particular values of R, L, and C, which I", 
    "can change.", 
    "And then I will show you the current as", 
    "a function of frequency.", 
    "And these are the values that I have chosen.", 
    "Again, this is on the web.", 
    "You can download it, so you don't have to copy it now.", 
    "And I will change the light setting so that we can also", 
    "enjoy the demonstration.", 
    "The idea being that for these values that I have there, in", 
    "the first line you see R, 60 ohms, and the self-inductance", 
    "is a 50 milliHenry, and the capacitance is 0.3", 
    "microfarads.", 
    "So that's a given there.", 
    "And I give you here a resonance frequency, 8,000 in", 
    "terms of omega radians per seconds.", 
    "This is the resonance frequency in Hertz.", 
    "And just in case you're interested, I give you the Q", 
    "value there as well.", 
    "And what I'm going to do now for you is, I'm going to sweep", 
    "the input frequency from 0 to 16,000 radians per second.", 
    "So my omega can go from 0 to 16,000.", 
    "And I leave the values as they are here.", 
    "So I'm going to sweep over this 8,000.", 
    "And so you're going to see that curve, except that I'm", 
    "going to show you I as a function of", 
    "frequency, not I max.", 
    "And I is also oscillating, because there's a cosine term.", 
    "And so for instance, if I were here, with this value for", 
    "omega, you would see then that it goes up and goes down and", 
    "goes up and goes down and goes up and it goes down.", 
    "And when I'm here, you will see this.", 
    "Keep that in mind when you look at the curve that you're", 
    "going to see there.", 
    "And so it's only the envelope, then, that is the I max.", 
    "But you actually see the entire current as a function", 
    "of frequency.", 
    "And I'm going to do that for all these four values", 
    "that you see there.", 
    "So let's first change the light so that we get an", 
    "optimum situation for you.", 
    "And now I will show you all ready the results", 
    "of the first line.", 
    "So these are the values that you see there.", 
    "And I go very slowly.", 
    "Now omega is 0 here.", 
    "Omega goes up.", 
    "I go through resonance.", 
    "And omega is here, the value would be 16,000 radians per", 
    "second that we have here, and it sweeps back and forth", 
    "between 0 and 16,000.", 
    "So you see a dramatic increase in resonance.", 
    "So now what I'm going to do, I'm going to double the", 
    "self-inductance.", 
    "And when you double the self-inductance,", 
    "this one goes up--", 
    "omega 0 goes down.", 
    "So all I want you to see, that the resonance frequency which", 
    "is here, that's the maximum, that the resonance frequency", 
    "will shift.", 
    "Because if L goes up by a factor of 2, the resonance", 
    "frequency will come down by the square root of 2.", 
    "And so I am going to increase L by a factor of 2.", 
    "I'll make sure that I have the right knob here, and this is", 
    "my L. And notice that the resonance frequency is now at", 
    "a lower value-- it is here.", 
    "Also notice that the peak value at", 
    "resonance has not changed.", 
    "Because the peak value at resonance, you see on the", 
    "blackboard here, is V 0 over R. So as long as I don't", 
    "change R, that doesn't change.", 
    "It's only the frequency that changes.", 
    "Omega 0 is 1 over the square root of L C. That changes.", 
    "It's now here.", 
    "So I have increased L by a factor of 2.", 
    "I can bring it back to my original resonance frequency", 
    "by now changing C. If you increase L by a factor of 2,", 
    "all you have to do is decrease C by factor of 2, and you're", 
    "back at the same resonance.", 
    "So I'm going to make C down, C lower by a factor of 2, which", 
    "I'm doing now.", 
    "And if you look here, you have a good memory.", 
    "You will see that the resonance frequency is back", 
    "where it was.", 
    "Again, V 0 over R is not changed, and the resonant", 
    "frequency is back here, even though L is now twice higher", 
    "and C is twice lower.", 
    "To show you the effect of R, I will double R now.", 
    "And I will leave everything else alone, so the resonance", 
    "frequency will stay here.", 
    "But of course the maximum current, this high value will", 
    "now come down.", 
    "Because you see, at resonance this value is V 0 over R, and", 
    "since R goes up by factor of 2, you will see that the", 
    "maximum current will go down by a factor of 2.", 
    "And so I go from 60--", 
    "from 50?", 
    "No, I go from 60 to 100.", 
    "I don't double it.", 
    "I can't go any further than 100.", 
    "But you see a substantial reduction.", 
    "So if you're ready for this, remember this height.", 
    "And now you see 100 ohms, and it is much lower.", 
    "It was this high before, and it's only here.", 
    "But notice the resonance frequency has not changed.", 
    "So this is an extremely interesting behavior.", 
    "And every time you have to think through what is", 
    "happening, you have not much intuition for", 
    "it, you're not alone.", 
    "I don't have much intuition for that either.", 
    "But with these rather simple equations, they're really not", 
    "that difficult.", 
    "Here, this is really the heart of the equation.", 
    "And then, of course, your tangent phi, in case you're", 
    "interested in the phase lag.", 
    "And they're really not that difficult.", 
    "I will not hold you responsible for being able to", 
    "derive the solution.", 
    "I give you the solution.", 
    "But with that solution, you can do a lot.", 
    "You can understand the behavior of the", 
    "circuits quite well.", 
    "Now I'm going to do a demonstration, and I warn you,", 
    "you have to follow very closely, step by step, what", 
    "I'm going to do.", 
    "Because if you miss one small step, you're lost for the next", 
    "12 minutes.", 
    "Completely lost.", 
    "You will just see nice things, but you don't know what you're", 
    "looking at.", 
    "So follow me closely.", 
    "I have an LRC circuit, and the LRC circuit is right here.", 
    "This is my L, 0.1 Henry.", 
    "These are my Cs, and this is my R. It's a", 
    "200 watt light bulb.", 
    "I've an LRC circuit.", 
    "And I'll give you the values for L, for R, and for C. I'm", 
    "going to drive it at 60 hertz.", 
    "So omega equals 377 radians per second.", 
    "And whatever you're going to see for the next 12 minutes,", 
    "that is not going to change.", 
    "That frequency is a given.", 
    "I simply plug it into the wall, and so my driving", 
    "voltage is 110 times the square root of 2 times the", 
    "cosine of omega t.", 
    "And it is this omega.", 
    "So it's the 110 volts that comes out of", 
    "the wall, so to speak.", 
    "My light bulb R is 60 ohms when it is hot, and it is a", 
    "200 watt bulb.", 
    "So if it's bright, 200 watt bulb.", 
    "The self-inductance L is 0.1 Henry, and the capacitance is",
