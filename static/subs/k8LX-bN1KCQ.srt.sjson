    "WALTER LEWIN: And the secondary has a radius--", 
    "this one of course has a radius of 42.4", 
    "degrees for the red.", 
    "And the blue would have a smaller radius.", 
    "The secondary has a radius for the red of 50.4 degrees.", 
    "So in the red, it's 50.4 degrees.", 
    "And in the blue, it's larger.", 
    "So the blue is outside, 52.5 degrees.", 
    "Is that what it is?", 
    "53.5.", 
    "The secondary's always fainter, and it is also wider.", 
    "Because you see, this separation in terms of angle", 
    "is larger than the separation there.", 
    "That's only 1.7 degrees and this is more than 3 degrees.", 
    "And so there is a secondary bow.", 
    "And the secondary bow is only about roughly 10 degrees above", 
    "the primary.", 
    "So if you see your primary at 42 degree angles away from", 
    "your shadow there and there and there, go another 10", 
    "degrees and you should see a second bow.", 
    "And you should see the colors reversed.", 
    "Red is there on the outside and blue is on the inside.", 
    "Red is on the outside and blue is on the inside.", 
    "Red is on the outside and blue is on the inside.", 
    "But here it is reversed.", 
    "The secondary bow, the red is on the inside and the blue is", 
    "on the outside.", 
    "So let's answer some questions now.", 
    "We'll put the questions back up again.", 
    "And you'll see that you can now without any difficulty", 
    "already answer 12 questions.", 
    "The first 12, red is outside.", 
    "That is non-negotiable.", 
    "That follows immediately from what we talked about.", 
    "But that's not an issue anymore.", 
    "The radius is about 42 degrees.", 
    "And the lengths of the bow?", 
    "Well, that depends.", 
    "Only if the sun is high in the sky then the length will be", 
    "very small, because this whole arc will then go down and", 
    "there will only be a little bit left.", 
    "It could also be that it's only raining here and it's not", 
    "raining there.", 
    "So depending upon where there's rain and how high the", 
    "sun is in the sky, that will determine the", 
    "length of the bow.", 
    "The width of the bow, you would think, perhaps naively,", 
    "that if you subtract the 40.7 from the 42.4 that that would", 
    "give you the width of the bow, which would then be 1.7", 
    "degrees in angle.", 
    "However you would overlook then that the sun is not a", 
    "point, but that the sun in the sky has a dimension of half a", 
    "degree, and each point of the sun of course makes its own", 
    "little rainbow.", 
    "So you really have to add roughly half a degree.", 
    "So the width of the bow is more like something like 2", 
    "degrees, rather than the 1.7, maybe 2.2 degrees.", 
    "It's a little wider than what you would think.", 
    "It has to do with the finite size of the sun.", 
    "A comparison of the light inside and outside, clearly", 
    "inside the bow there must be a lot of light, light that you", 
    "don't see outside the bow.", 
    "Big difference, you will see a slide shortly.", 
    "The time of the day.", 
    "Well, the sun has to be a little bit low.", 
    "So you don't expect it at midday and you want rain as", 
    "well, so late afternoon, early morning would be ideal.", 
    "And you can figure out in what direction to look.", 
    "If it's early morning, the sun rises in the east, you would", 
    "see the bow is in the west.", 
    "And late in the afternoon when the sun is in the west, you", 
    "would see the bows in the east.", 
    "There is a second bow.", 
    "It is about 10 degrees higher in the sky than the primary.", 
    "And the colors are reversed.", 
    "The blue is outside and the red is inside.", 
    "And the radius is about 52 degrees.", 
    "And the width of the bow is, again, the difference between", 
    "these two numbers.", 
    "But you have to add about half a degree.", 
    "So you would think on the basis of this that it is more", 
    "like 3 degrees.", 
    "And you have to add roughly half a degree.", 
    "So it's about 3.5 degrees.", 
    "So let's now look at some slides.", 
    "And the first slide that you will see is a drawing that I", 
    "made, which is meant to repeat some of what I told you.", 
    "So you see a person standing there.", 
    "And here you see the direction to the sun.", 
    "Your shadow would be this long.", 
    "This will be your head of the shadow.", 
    "Here would be your feet.", 
    "And if there are water drops here and if there's no", 
    "interference between the sunlight and the water drops,", 
    "then in this direction, 42 degrees, you would see this", 
    "water drop red.", 
    "And then the water droplets were here, you would see white", 
    "light from those water drops.", 
    "And maybe from this one you would see red as well as blue.", 
    "And if you have water near your feet, there's no reason", 
    "why you can't see the rainbow there either.", 
    "But of course, you would have to need some garden hose to", 
    "produce water there.", 
    "The next slide then.", 
    "This is a drawing made by the meister himself, Newton, who", 
    "was the first to fully understand the", 
    "workings of the rainbow.", 
    "You see here the primary bow.", 
    "And for those of you who are sitting close, you can see the", 
    "direction of the sun, light going in at A, reflects at B,", 
    "coming out at C, which he calls E, but that's a detail.", 
    "And here you see then the secondary whereby", 
    "the light comes in.", 
    "One reflection, two reflections, and now it comes", 
    "back at you.", 
    "And that gives you the secondary.", 
    "And so this is red and this is blue, whereas here, this is", 
    "blue and this is red.", 
    "The next slide.", 
    "So if the sun is high in the sky, I've done this many times", 
    "when I was watering my garden.", 
    "You get this for free.", 
    "You might as well do this.", 
    "It's great fun.", 
    "You're standing there.", 
    "It gives you an immense feeling of power.", 
    "And it's completely clear.", 
    "There's not a cloud in the sky.", 
    "And there's no rain anywhere.", 
    "But you spray water around you.", 
    "And you see a beautiful rainbow encircling your feet.", 
    "Always what matters is this 42 degree angle relative to the", 
    "direction from the sun to you.", 
    "And this is where the shadow of my head would be.", 
    "Very easy to do, and I would recommend that you try that", 
    "when you get a chance.", 
    "The next slide Is a painting from the", 
    "eighth century Turkey.", 
    "I see a hand here.", 
    "It probably makes reference to the Bible.", 
    "Because I think it reads in the Bible, I do set my bow in", 
    "the clouds.", 
    "It's very nice and very dandy.", 
    "The fact that the colors are wrong, the sequence of the", 
    "colors, that's a detail.", 
    "It's a nice picture.", 
    "But red has to be on the outside and blue has to be on", 
    "the inside.", 
    "Small detail.", 
    "Next slide.", 
    "A few years ago-- actually it's more than a few--", 
    "when I was first lecturing 8.03, I knew I was going to", 
    "talk about the rainbow, ideal for 8.03.", 
    "And so I wanted to make some rainbows myself in my backyard", 
    "in Winchester.", 
    "So there is water coming out of a water hose.", 
    "And the sun was behind me and I took this picture.", 
    "You see indeed all the ingredients", 
    "that we just discussed.", 
    "Notice the red is on the outside and the", 
    "blue is on the inside.", 
    "You see all this white light?", 
    "That is that light that comes back from the water drops.", 
    "But if you go here where the angle of phi will be larger", 
    "than 42 degrees, which is not allowed, you don't see any", 
    "light coming back at you.", 
    "So you look straight through and see the forest without any", 
    "white light.", 
    "So you really see already here, sky, so to speak, is", 
    "bright here and darker there.", 
    "I needed help from my daughter.", 
    "And the next slide will show you that.", 
    "The poor darling was suffering badly.", 
    "It was January.", 
    "It was freezing cold.", 
    "She was crying.", 
    "She was really crying and I feel guilty.", 
    "But I said look, I really need the slides for my 8.03 class.", 
    "It will only take you an hour or so.", 
    "And she still remembers it.", 
    "I had email exchange with her yesterday.", 
    "And she said, dad, I was crying.", 
    "It was an awful thing what you did to me.", 
    "But look, you've got to do something.", 
    "And when you're the daughter of a scientist occasionally", 
    "you have to suffer a little bit.", 
    "So she's holding here the water hose.", 
    "And you see the same thing, red outside, blue inside, and", 
    "clearly the white light.", 
    "You see this is that white light that I discussed with", 
    "you earlier.", 
    "The next slide will show you a real rainb-- oh no, this is", 
    "the artificial one I made over my driveway.", 
    "If you want to see the secondary, you need a real", 
    "dark background.", 
    "Because the secondary is quite faint.", 
    "And so that's why I did it over my driveway.", 
    "And you see here the primary, red on the outside, blue on", 
    "the inside.", 
    "And here you see the colors reversed.", 
    "You can also see perhaps that it's a little wider.", 
    "But it's much fainter so it's hard to tell.", 
    "And then the next slide is one that's a wonderful slide made", 
    "by Doug Johnson in New Mexico.", 
    "Socorro, which is where the radio telescopes are in the", 
    "very large array.", 
    "Now look, red on the outside, blue on the inside.", 
    "The sky, you've got to admit, is a hell of a lot brighter", 
    "here than it is there.", 
    "And you may never have noticed that.", 
    "You've looked at it but you've never seen it.", 
    "And then you see the secondary, red on the inside,", 
    "blue on the outside.", 
    "There is a phenomenon that we've never", 
    "discussed in 8.02 yet.", 
    "It's coming up I think next week.", 
    "And that phenomenon we call diffraction.", 
    "Snell's law cannot deal with diffraction.", 
    "That occurs when water drops are very, very small, smaller", 
    "than a tenth of a millimeter.", 
    "What you then get over and above the bow, you get areas", 
    "in the bow whereby you get, as we call that, destructive", 
    "interference.", 
    "The waves begin to kill each other and you get dark bands.", 
    "And you can actually see that here.", 
    "With a little bit of imagination, you", 
    "see here a dark band.", 
    "And when that is the case, the water is always extremely", 
    "small in size.", 
    "And we give this a name.", 
    "We call this supernumerary bows.", 
    "It's not so uncommon.", 
    "|f the water drops become exceedingly small, let's say", 
    "smaller even than 50 microns, then this diffraction", 
    "phenomenon becomes so important that in addition to", 
    "the dark bands, all the colors are beginning to wash out over", 
    "each other.", 
    "And that creates then a white rainbow, plus the dark bands.", 
    "And a student of mine who was in my 8.03 lecture sent me", 
    "years later the next slide.", 
    "His name was Carl Wales.", 
    "This picture he took 340 miles from the North Pole.", 
    "He was at Fletcher Island at the time.", 
    "This picture was taken at 2:00 AM at night in July when the", 
    "sun is above the horizon.", 
    "This must be the result of very fine water drops which", 
    "somehow are there in the atmosphere.", 
    "Doesn't look like it's raining but there must have been small", 
    "water drops 50 microns or less.", 
    "And here you see the white colored rainbow.", 
    "And you also see beautifully the supernumerary bows.", 
    "You see the dark bands in there.", 
    "The next slide is a closeup of that.", 
    "So you see here the white rainbow plus the dark bands,", 
    "which is the phenomenon, the result of diffraction.", 
    "Now before I will discuss the polarization of the bows,", 
    "because I still owe you answers to the last three", 
    "questions, now that I'm at it, I want to show you some", 
    "phenomena which are quite common, which you may never", 
    "have seen even though they're quite common, and they're", 
    "rather spectacular.", 
    "The first slide that comes now shows you what we call the 22", 
    "degree halo.", 
    "It's very common around the sun.", 
    "It's very common around the moon.", 
    "The red is inside.", 
    "It has nothing to do with water.", 
    "It is the result of ice crystals way up in the", 
    "atmosphere.", 
    "You could see it both in the summer as well as in the", 
    "winter, because it's very cold way up", 
    "there also in the summer.", 
    "This is very common.", 
    "The reason why you and I don't see that often because who", 
    "wants to look in the direction of the sun?", 
    "This angle is only 22 degrees.", 
    "It's not so far.", 
    "But I would advise you to at least keep an eye on the moon,", 
    "because the moon also has this 22 degree halo.", 
    "And of course, it's much easier to look in the", 
    "direction of the moon.", 
    "It doesn't--", 
    "no problems for your eyes.", 
    "This is very common.", 
    "I see this at least three or four times per month.", 
    "And I always look for it of course.", 
    "The next slide shows you both the 22 degree halo as well as", 
    "the 46 degree halo, which is way less common.", 
    "It's very rare to see the 46 degree.", 
    "I've seen it only a few times.", 
    "It's very rare.", 
    "In addition to the 22 degree halo and the 46 degree halo,", 
    "you sometimes see bright spots here.", 
    "You see them here and you see them here.", 
    "They're really not circles.", 
    "They're arcs.", 
    "And they have names.", 
    "They call them sun dogs, mock suns.", 
    "They have various names.", 
    "I've seen this often in Boston.", 
    "The 46 degree halo is rare.", 
    "All of this is the result, by the way, of ice crystals, ice", 
    "crystals way up in the Earth's atmosphere.", 
    "There is a phenomenon that many of you may have seen from", 
    "an airplane.", 
    "If your airplane flies over clouds and you look at the", 
    "shadow of your airplane onto the cloud, you may have", 
    "noticed colorful wings around the shadow of your airplane.", 
    "The next slide is such an example.", 
    "I took this picture several years ago.", 
    "You are always right at the center of the circle.", 
    "So you can see that I was sitting just behind the wings.", 
    "This is the result of diffraction.", 
    "It has nothing to do with Snell's Law.", 
    "It is the result of very, very fine water drops, but not in", 
    "the sense of refraction and reflection the way that we", 
    "discussed it with the rainbow.", 
    "This is the result of diffraction.", 
    "It's extremely difficult, the explanation of the glory.", 
    "And even 10 years ago I read an enormous article about it,", 
    "I think it was in Scientific American, which made another", 
    "attempt to be very quantitative about the", 
    "explanation, which is not easy.", 
    "The radius of this bow, if you want to call it a bow, depends", 
    "on the size of the water drops.", 
    "If the water drops are very small, the radius is", 
    "substantially larger.", 
    "So as you fly over clouds, you may fly over different clouds", 
    "with different size of water drops.", 
    "And on a very short time scale, will you see the radius", 
    "of this glory change.", 
    "It could be very rapidly.", 
    "It could become a time scale of seconds to minutes.", 
    "It's very dramatic.", 
    "It's very clear.", 
    "And these rings can extend.", 
    "There's not one ring, but you can have several rings.", 
    "So this is the result of what we call diffraction.", 
    "Now I want to mention to you another phenomenon which is", 
    "also the result of diffraction.", 
    "And that you can see when there is fog.", 
    "If you have fog, fog consists of extremely small water drops", 
    "just like the ones in clouds.", 
    "I mean, fog is a cloud.", 
    "Let's face it.", 
    "Then if you for instance had the headlights of a car, you", 
    "could see your own shadow on through the fog, away from the", 
    "direction of the car.", 
    "And that means you could see then around your head the same", 
    "kinds of stuff that you saw here, a glory.", 
    "And so you see this around your head.", 
    "So it is sort of the radiation that you would", 
    "expect from a saint.", 
    "Quite a few years ago I was invited to", 
    "visit the Soviet Union.", 
    "And they took me to the Caucasus to show me the", 
    "6-meter telescope, which was at the time the largest", 
    "telescope on earth.", 
    "And I went there for a few days.", 
    "And I noticed, much to my surprise, that every night at", 
    "5 o'clock, there would be fog coming out of the valley,", 
    "overtaking the telescope so you could make no", 
    "observations at night.", 
    "But that was a detail.", 
    "And what I realized is that the fog was coming up.", 
    "The sun was there.", 
    "That was the west, and the valley was at the east.", 
    "I said to myself, oh my goodness, if only at the right", 
    "moment of time I am there, then the sun is my light beam,", 
    "and my shadow will fall onto this wall of fog coming", 
    "towards me, this is my chance to make a wonderful picture.", 
    "And I'll show you that I succeeded.", 
    "I will first show you a picture of this bizarre", 
    "observatory.", 
    "This is the 6-meter telescope in the Caucasus.", 
    "And this is indeed--", 
    "you could every night around 5:30, really like a wall the", 
    "fog was just coming towards you, overtake you.", 
    "You can see the timing of my picture was extremely crucial.", 
    "If you wait a little bit too long then the fog overtakes", 
    "you, and then the sun would obviously not", 
    "be effective anymore.", 
    "I wouldn't see my shadow on the fog.", 
    "So I only had a small time window, maybe 30 seconds,", 
    "maybe one minute.", 
    "But I succeeded, and you will see Saint Walter coming up.", 
    "There is Saint Walter.", 
    "You can see here my arm, and you can see here my camera.", 
    "The camera must be exactly at the center of the glory.", 
    "And that's where it is.", 
    "I have the camera right here.", 
    "And here you see the rest of my body.", 
    "Isn't that terrific?", 
    "This can be used as proof sooner or later.", 
    "OK, back to our last three questions.", 
    "The last three questions deal with the", 
    "polarization of the bow.", 
    "Are the bows polarized?", 
    "And the answer is yes.", 
    "They are enormously polarized.", 
    "Why are they polarized?", 
    "You can answer that question."
