    "WALTER LEWIN: That means, if you look at this cone of light", 
    "that goes back into the direction of the sun, that's", 
    "the outer edge, the outer surface of that cone, which", 
    "has the largest possible angle--", 
    "this angle is 42.4 degrees, must be red light because blue", 
    "light cannot come out in that direction because the maximum", 
    "angle for blue is 40.7.", 
    "It's not 42.4.", 
    "So it's only red light that can come out when the half", 
    "angle of the cone is 42.4 degrees.", 
    "And the blue light is not going to make it until this", 
    "angle here, I'll put it in here, is 40.7 degrees.", 
    "If you look inside the cone, with an half top angle of 40.7", 
    "degrees, all colors can come back.", 
    "All this is saying is, that for a red light,", 
    "phi maximum is 42.4.", 
    "It can also therefore be 40.7.", 
    "It can be 30.", 
    "It can be 20.", 
    "It can be 10.", 
    "It can be zero.", 
    "Light that comes in here, at i equals 0, reaches point p,", 
    "comes straight back.", 
    "That's allowed.", 
    "Phi would be zero, then.", 
    "If all the colors can make it back inside this cone that I", 
    "have given, here, a blue color, that would mean that", 
    "your brains will tell you that it is white light.", 
    "Because you see red light, you see blue light, you see green", 
    "light, you see yellow light.", 
    "And so your brains will tell you that that is white light.", 
    "If I had a screen here with a small opening to let the", 
    "sunlight in, and I asked you, what would you see on this", 
    "screen, having only one water drop, now you would see", 
    "intersection of this cone of light with the screen.", 
    "And that would look as follows--", 
    "the outer edge, the outer circle, which is the", 
    "intersection of the cone with your screen, would be red.", 
    "And then there would be an inner portion whereby all", 
    "colors can come back.", 
    "So that would be white light.", 
    "And then, as you go further in from the red, until you reach", 
    "that white portion, then the last color that will be added", 
    "is the blue.", 
    "And you can already, of course, sense that all the", 
    "action about the rainbow occurs here.", 
    "And here, there is no light.", 
    "It's going to be dark because there is no way that phi can", 
    "be larger than 42.4 degrees.", 
    "And if light would appear on the screen outside the red, it", 
    "means that phi would be larger than 42.4 degrees.", 
    "And that's not allowed.", 
    "So it's dark here.", 
    "It's white light here.", 
    "It's red light here.", 
    "And as you go further in, you will finally", 
    "see the other colors.", 
    "And this really is now the key to the", 
    "geometry of the rainbow.", 
    "I'm going to put you here--", 
    "so here, you're standing--", 
    "and let the sun, again, be near the horizon.", 
    "It's always nice when you make a picture, an easy reference", 
    "that you have.", 
    "You're standing here.", 
    "Sunlight is coming in this direction.", 
    "And there is rain here.", 
    "If it's also raining here, you won't see a rainbow, because", 
    "the sun will not be able to hit these raindrops.", 
    "So it's essential that it's raining in the direction away", 
    "from the sun, but you can still see the sun.", 
    "So here are these raindrops.", 
    "All right, you're looking in this direction in the sky.", 
    "You're looking up in this sky like so.", 
    "And I pick here one raindrop, and only one, but what I'm", 
    "telling you holds for all the raindrops in that direction.", 
    "What will that raindrop do?", 
    "That raindrop will produce a cone of light which goes back", 
    "in the direction of the sun whereby the edge of the cone", 
    "is red light, and this angle is 42 degrees, 42.4, whatever.", 
    "What do you see?", 
    "Nothing.", 
    "Because there's no light that can come from this raindrop in", 
    "your direction.", 
    "There's no light because that would mean that phi is larger", 
    "than 42 degrees.", 
    "And that's not allowed.", 
    "So you look high up in the sky--", 
    "you will not see any light coming", 
    "back from that raindrop.", 
    "And think of the whole thing as axial symmetric, right?", 
    "Not only there, but there, and there, you", 
    "will not see any light.", 
    "Now I am looking, say, at some raindrops which are here.", 
    "I pick one.", 
    "It holds for anyone in that direction.", 
    "And so now, I draw a line to this point.", 
    "This is what I'm looking.", 
    "I look in this direction.", 
    "I take this raindrop.", 
    "I could've picked this raindrop.", 
    "I could have picked this one.", 
    "Would've made no difference.", 
    "What is that raindrop doing?", 
    "Well, that raindrop is throwing back at the sun light", 
    "in the form of a cone.", 
    "And the cone has this angle, 42 degrees, 42 degrees.", 
    "What do you see now?", 
    "Look, you're looking straight into that cone.", 
    "You're nowhere near the edge, so you see white light because", 
    "green light comes back at you.", 
    "Red light comes back at you--", 
    "everything comes back at you.", 
    "So you will say, ha, I see white light--", 
    "not only there, low in the horizon, but the whole thing", 
    "is actual symmetric, also there and there.", 
    "So you haven't seen a rainbow yet.", 
    "But now, suppose I ask you to look up in the sky at a very", 
    "specific angle.", 
    "I will make the angle 42.4 degrees.", 
    "So you're looking at the sky in the direction--", 
    "somewhere here.", 
    "I must make sure that I have the angle just right.", 
    "So I'm looking in the sky here.", 
    "Pick one raindrop.", 
    "But you could pick any one, any other one.", 
    "There's nothing special about that one.", 
    "So the sunlight comes in like so.", 
    "What is that raindrop doing?", 
    "Well, it's throwing a cone of light back to the sun.", 
    "And it just so happens that you are only looking at the", 
    "outer surface of the cone, where only red light can go", 
    "because this is the famous angle of 42.4 degrees.", 
    "And so you see red light.", 
    "And since the whole problem is axial symmetric, you would see", 
    "red light if you look 42.4 degrees in this direction, but", 
    "also 42 degrees in this direction, away from this", 
    "direction to the sun.", 
    "And so now you see how the bow is being formed by zillions", 
    "and zillions of small water drops, which, each of them, in", 
    "their own way, contribute to your rainbow.", 
    "And we'll now put the sun a little higher in the sky.", 
    "So I'll put you here now.", 
    "And let's say the sun is now like so.", 
    "So you look at your shadow here on the ground.", 
    "The sun is there.", 
    "There's your shadow.", 
    "Here's your shadow.", 
    "Here's your head, the shadow.", 
    "And this is the reference line that we are talking about.", 
    "That is this line.", 
    "That was this line.", 
    "And so where would you see a rainbow?", 
    "You have to look, now, 42 degrees away from that line,", 
    "42 degrees away from that line.", 
    "That would be red, then, and a little lower", 
    "would be your blue.", 
    "And so, if I sketch in there the bow, it would be", 
    "sort of like this.", 
    "And then the blue would be on the inside.", 
    "And here, you would have white light.", 
    "And this would then be the red.", 
    "It's always relative to this reference line.", 
    "So this would be, roughly, I call it 42 degrees.", 
    "But according to my calculation", 
    "there, it would be 42.4.", 
    "So whenever you know where the sun is, you look at the shadow", 
    "of your own head, and you have to go 42.4 degrees away from", 
    "that direction from your eye to the shadow.", 
    "And so what you see now is that, if the sun is low in the", 
    "horizon, then the bow will be high above the horizon.", 
    "And when the sun is rising, then the bow goes down, and", 
    "goes down, and goes down.", 
    "And by the time that the sun is 42 degrees above the", 
    "horizon, you're not going to see a rainbow anymore, unless", 
    "the water is right where you are.", 
    "If the water is at a distance, you won't see a rainbow.", 
    "So the higher the sun in the sky, the less likely it is", 
    "that you will ever see a rainbow.", 
    "Before I show you some slides and before we're going to", 
    "answer some of the questions, I wanted to mention to you", 
    "that what I went through here is refraction at A, reflection", 
    "at B, and coming out at C.", 
    "You can go through the same geometry, and allow for one", 
    "more reflection at C, and then let the light come out.", 
    "So it would come out at point D. And if you did that, you", 
    "can convince yourself that there is,", 
    "indeed, a second rainbow.", 
    "And we call that the secondary.", 
    "We call this the primary."
