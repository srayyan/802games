    "WALTER LEWIN: Can we make a standing wave?", 
    "Yes we can, and I will do that today.", 
    "A standing wave can be made by shaking, or rotating in that", 
    "fashion, a string.", 
    "So if you have a string, and say I attach the string to the", 
    "wall there, and I move it up and down here.", 
    "A wave goes in.", 
    "I do this like a rotating disk.", 
    "The wave travels, but the wave is reflected.", 
    "And so I have a wave going in and I have a wave coming back.", 
    "So now I have two waves going through each other.", 
    "And if the conditions are just the right, then these", 
    "reflective waves--", 
    "this one will reflect.", 
    "When it arrives here it will reflect again, and it goes", 
    "back again, and it will continue to reflect.", 
    "So if the conditions are just right, then these reflective", 
    "waves will support each other, and they will generate a large", 
    "amplitude, as I will demonstrate to you.", 
    "But that's only the case for very specific frequencies, and", 
    "we call those resonance frequencies.", 
    "The lowest possible frequency for which this happens, which", 
    "we call the fundamental, will make the string", 
    "vibrate like this.", 
    "So the whole thing goes--", 
    "[SWISHING NOISES]", 
    "and we call that the fundamental.", 
    "We call that also the first harmonic.", 
    "If now I increase the frequencies, then I get a", 
    "second resonance frequency, and a node", 
    "jumps in the middle.", 
    "There's already a node here and there's a node here,", 
    "because this motion of my hand here is very small, as I will", 
    "demonstrate to you.", 
    "For all practical purposes, you can think of", 
    "this being a node.", 
    "And so now the string in the second harmonic will", 
    "oscillate like this.", 
    "[SWISHING NOISES]", 
    "This is the second harmonic.", 
    "And if we go up in frequencies, then--", 
    "they should be right in the middle, by the way.", 
    "And if I go up in frequency one step more, then I get", 
    "another resonance whereby we get an extra node, so we get", 
    "the third harmonic.", 
    "And you can go on like that.", 
    "You get a whole series of resonance frequencies.", 
    "And so for the fundamental, lambda 1--", 
    "the 1 refers to the first harmonic--", 
    "is 2L, if L is the length of my string.", 
    "This is L. We only have half a wavelength here,", 
    "so lambda is 2L.", 
    "We know that the frequency is the velocity divided by the", 
    "wavelength.", 
    "We see that there.", 
    "Frequency is velocity divided by the wavelength.", 
    "So the frequency f1 is the velocity divided by lambda 1,", 
    "so that's divided by 2L.", 
    "So that's the frequency in the fundamental for which this", 
    "resonance phenomenon occurs.", 
    "For the second harmonic, lambda 2", 
    "equals L. You can tell.", 
    "You see a complete wavelength here.", 
    "And f2--", 
    "that frequency is going to be twice f1.", 
    "And f3 is going to be 3 times f1.", 
    "And if you want to know for the nth harmonic, n being", 
    "Nancy, then lambda of n equals 2L divided by n.", 
    "Substitute in n 1 and you find the wavelength", 
    "for the first harmonic.", 
    "Substitute for n 2, and you find a wavelength for the", 
    "second harmonic, and so on.", 
    "And the frequency for the nth harmonic--", 
    "n stands for Nancy, is n times v divided by 2L.", 
    "So here you see the entire series of frequencies and", 
    "wavelengths for which we have resonance.", 
    "Unlike in our LRC system that we discussed last time, where", 
    "you had one resonance frequency, now you have an", 
    "infinite number of resonance frequencies.", 
    "And they are at very discrete values, equally spaced.", 
    "I want to demonstrate this to you with a violin string.", 
    "It's a very special violin string.", 
    "It's here on the floor.", 
    "It's a biggie.", 
    "And I need some help from someone.", 
    "You've helped me before.", 
    "Would you mind helping me again?", 
    "So here is one end of the string, which", 
    "you're going to hold.", 
    "You're going to be a node, believe it or not.", 
    "Hold it better-- two hands.", 
    "No, much better.", 
    "You will see shortly why.", 
    "No, no, no--", 
    "much better.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "Now walk back a little.", 
    "Walk further.", 
    "That's good.", 
    "Hold it.", 
    "I will put on a white glove, and there's a reason for that.", 
    "Because I want you to be able to see my hand when we're", 
    "going to make it dark, so that you will convince yourself", 
    "that my hands, which is generating the wave, is hardly", 
    "moving at all.", 
    "For practical purposes, it's a node, and yet we get these", 
    "wonderful resonance phenomenon.", 
    "So I'm going to make it very dark so that the UV will do", 
    "its job, and you can see the string better.", 
    "That's the only way we can make you see the string well.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Don't let go under any circumstances.", 
    "You will hurt me if you do that.", 
    "Of course, if I let go first, then I will hurt you, but", 
    "that's not my plan.", 
    "So let's try to go a little bit further back.", 
    "Let's try to find first the fundamental.", 
    "And I'll try to find it by exciting just the right", 
    "frequency with my hand.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "I think I got it.", 
    "That's the fundamental.", 
    "And look how little my hand is moving here, and you will see", 
    "a very large amplitude in the middle.", 
    "And so these reflective waves--", 
    "one runs to him and it then comes back to me.", 
    "And when it reaches me, it runs back to him again.", 
    "It keeps reflecting many times.", 
    "These reflective waves support each other.", 
    "That's what resonance is all about.", 
    "And now I'll try to find the second harmonic.", 
    "So you'll see another node coming into the middle.", 
    "It's easier for you to see than for me, actually.", 
    "And it's not always easy to find.", 
    "Nope, nope, nope.", 
    "I'm too low frequency.", 
    "Have to go up.", 
    "I think I got it now.", 
    "Is this it?", 
    "One extra node in the middle?", 
    "Speak up please!", 
    "STUDENTS: Yes!", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Ah, that's better.", 
    "Now I can hear you.", 
    "Thank you.", 
    "There are three nodes now.", 
    "My friend there is a node, I'm a node, and then there's one", 
    "in the middle.", 
    "If you subtract one--", 
    "if 3 minus 1 is 2, then it's a second harmonic.", 
    "And so now I will try to generate a very high frequency", 
    "in resonance, and then you count the number of nodes.", 
    "Subtract one, and then you know which harmonic I was able", 
    "to generate.", 
    "So now I'll try to--", 
    "it's not so easy.", 
    "You need to get a resonance in there.", 
    "No, I'm off resonance.", 
    "No.", 
    "Yeah, yeah, yeah!", 
    "Got It!", 
    "Got it!", 
    "Got it!", 
    "Got it!", 
    "You keep counting!", 
    "Keep counting!", 
    "Oh, that's a super high harmonic!", 
    "How many did you count?", 
    "STUDENTS: Six!", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: 10, do I hear 10?", 
    "STUDENTS: Six!", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Do I hear 20?", 
    "STUDENTS: [LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Actually, I counted.", 
    "It's About 27, but that's OK.", 
    "All right, thank you very much.", 
    "It was great that you helped me.", 
    "STUDENTS: [APPLAUSE]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: So that's a standing wave.", 
    "And you see the shapes, and you saw the mode of operation,", 
    "very characteristic for standing waves.", 
    "When I pluck a string--", 
    "a violin.", 
    "Or I strike it with a bow, or with a hammer on a piano--", 
    "just, the hammer comes down.", 
    "That is exposing the string to a whole set of frequencies.", 
    "And so the string now decides which frequencies it likes to", 
    "oscillate in.", 
    "And so it selects these resonance frequencies.", 
    "And so if the string has a fundamental of 400 Hertz, then", 
    "it would start to resonate at 400, but simultaneously it", 
    "would be very happy with 800 Hertz and with 1,200 Hertz.", 
    "And so the string will simultaneously--", 
    "if I bang it or strike it or pluck it-- simultaneously", 
    "oscillate, often at more than one frequency, fundamental and", 
    "several of the higher harmonics.", 
    "And all the others that are present-- all the other", 
    "frequencies in this striking with the bow are ignored.", 
    "They're off resonance.", 
    "So if you design a string instrument, then this is", 
    "really a key equation.", 
    "If you want a particular fundamental, say your", 
    "fundamental is 440, and this is a given number.", 
    "And so n is 1.", 
    "You can now manipulate v, because v depends on the", 
    "tension in the string, and it depends on what kind", 
    "of string you have.", 
    "The speed in the string is the square root of the tension--", 
    "if you take 8.03, you'll even see a proof of that--", 
    "divided by the mass of the string per unit", 
    "length of the string.", 
    "So you take four strings for violins, six for guitar, you", 
    "make them out of very different material--", 
    "different mass per unit length.", 
    "And so that gives you different velocities.", 
    "You can also fool around with the tension.", 
    "And so the four strings then have all four different", 
    "fundamentals.", 
    "In a violin, they may have the same length.", 
    "What are you going to do now to play the violin?", 
    "All that is left over is L-- that's the only thing you can", 
    "change, and that's what the violinist is doing.", 
    "Goes with the finger back and forth over the strings.", 
    "Make them shorter, pitch goes up, frequency goes up.", 
    "Makes them longer, frequency goes down.", 
    "And you do the same with a guitar, and you do the same", 
    "with a bass and a cello.", 
    "So while you're playing, what you're doing all the time is", 
    "changing L, so that you get all these frequencies that you", 
    "want to produce.", 
    "If you take your instrument out of the closet, you may", 
    "have noticed that it's not really in tune anymore.", 
    "It's slightly off-tune.", 
    "Well, what you can do now, you can change v a little bit.", 
    "It has these little knobs, and you can change the tension in", 
    "the strings.", 
    "And that's what's violinists do when", 
    "they tune their violin.", 
    "They change the tension on the string to get", 
    "just the right frequency.", 
    "But the playing means you change L.", 
    "A piano is different.", 
    "That's really a luxury.", 
    "A piano is 88 keys, and the length of each set of strings", 
    "is fixed, so you don't have to worry about that.", 
    "It's a great luxury.", 
    "You may think, therefore, that it is much easier to play the", 
    "piano than to play a violin, because you don't have to do", 
    "this all the time and be exactly at the right length.", 
    "Well, that is true of course, but given the fact that you", 
    "have 88 keys, you can imagine you can also hit occasionally", 
    "the wrong key, and that's not what you want.", 
    "If a string is vibrating, it is pushing on the air.", 
    "And it's pulling on the air, and is producing thereby what", 
    "we call pressure waves.", 
    "If I have a string that oscillates 400 Hertz, it makes", 
    "pressure waves.", 
    "Pressure goes up, down, up, down, up, down.", 
    "400 times per second, it goes up.", 
    "It reaches your eardrum and your eardrum starts to shake.", 
    "400 times per seconds goes back and forth, and your brain", 
    "say, I hear sound.", 
    "That's the way it works.", 
    "So it is the string, then you get the air pressure waves,", 
    "and then you get your eardrum, and then you get the brains,", 
    "if there are any.", 
    "Now I want to discuss with you-- before I demonstrate", 
    "some of this, I want to discuss with you instruments", 
    "which don't have strings.", 
    "And I will call them all woodwind instruments, although", 
    "that's perhaps not an appropriate", 
    "name for all of them.", 
    "But I'll just call them woodwinds for now.", 
    "And suppose I have here a box which is filled with air, a", 
    "completely closed box.", 
    "It has a length L. And I put in here a loud speaker, and I", 
    "generate a particular frequency of sound.", 
    "Then the pressure waves are going to run, they're going to", 
    "bounce off, and they come back, and I get reflected", 
    "travelling waves.", 
    "And what I get inside the box now--", 
    "I get standing waves of air.", 
    "It's not the box that goes into a standing resonance, but", 
    "it is the air itself.", 
    "And the frequencies that are produced at which the system", 
    "is in resonance, is given by exactly the same equation,", 
    "except now that v is non-negotiable.", 
    "V is now the speed of sound, which at room temperature is", 
    "about 340 meters per second.", 
    "So whenever you design woodwind instruments, that is", 
    "non-negotiable.", 
    "You cannot change v, which you can do when you are an", 
    "instrument builder of strings.", 
    "You will say, gee, if I have an instrument whereby the", 
    "sound is inside a closed box, you're not going", 
    "to hear very much.", 
    "Well, that's true.", 
    "You must let the sound go out somehow.", 
    "And what is surprising, that if you take this end off and", 
    "you take this end off, that this box, which is now open on", 
    "both sides, will still resonate at exactly those", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "And you got to take 8.03 to get to the bottom of this.", 
    "There are also resonance frequencies, in case that the", 
    "sound cavity--", 
    "if I call this a sound cavity--", 
    "is closed on one end and open on one end.", 
    "The series of resonance frequencies is different from", 
    "this one, though.", 
    "It's not so important, but it is different.", 
    "But you also get a whole series of resonance", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "The velocity of sound in a gas, v, is the square root of", 
    "the temperature, so it's a little temperature dependent,", 
    "divided by the molecular weight.", 
    "Well, you can't do much about the temperature in a room.", 
    "In general, it's room temperature.", 
    "And with air, you're stuck with some molecular weight--", 
    "oxygen and nitrogen is about 30.", 
    "There's not much you can do about that.", 
    "But every one of you who plays woodwind instruments know if", 
    "you go from a cold room to a warm room, that your", 
    "instrument is no longer in tune.", 
    "And that's because of this.", 
    "The temperature changed, so v changes, so your", 
    "fundamentals change.", 
    "And what do you do now?", 
    "These people know what they do.", 
    "They have a way of making the cavity a little shorter or a", 
    "little longer.", 
    "It's not very much, but they have a", 
    "little bit to play with.", 
    "And when they do that, they compensate L for the slight", 
    "difference in v, to get back to the same", 
    "fundamental that they need.", 
    "So now you have a woodwind instrument.", 
    "Low frequency woodwind instruments will be big, and", 
    "high frequency woodwind instruments will be small.", 
    "Because in L lies the secret.", 
    "You can't fool around with v. v is a God-given.", 
    "So how do you play an instrument now?", 
    "Well, you have to change L-- that's all you can do.", 
    "And if you have a trombone, you doing this.", 
    "It's clear that you're changing L. You make the", 
    "cavity shorter and longer.", 
    "That's easy.", 
    "If you have a flute, you have holes in the flute, and if all", 
    "the holes are closed, the flute is this long.", 
    "But if you take your fingers off the", 
    "holes, it gets shorter.", 
    "And so when you take all your fingers off the holes, then", 
    "you have a high frequency.", 
    "The flute is only this long.", 
    "You put all your fingers on it-- it's this long, and so", 
    "the frequency is lower.", 
    "And a trumpet is the same idea.", 
    "You have valves that open holes and close holes.", 
    "If you blow air in an instrument, it is like", 
    "plucking a string. it's like exciting a string with a bow.", 
    "You're dumping a whole spectrum of frequencies onto", 
    "that air cavity, and you let the air cavity decide where it", 
    "wants to resonate.", 
    "And it'll pick out the ones that it likes.", 
    "It will pick out the fundamental, and maybe the", 
    "second and the third harmonic.", 
    "So in that sense, blowing air is like striking it with a bow", 
    "in the case of a string instrument.", 
    "But blowing air is not always as easy as you", 
    "may think it is.", 
    "Have you ever tried to blow air into a trumpet?", 
    "Nothing happens.", 
    "You just blow--", 
    "[SOFT BLOWING SOUND].", 
    "And you hear nothing.", 
    "You have to do this--", 
    "[LOUD BLOWING SOUND].", 
    "Something like that.", 
    "The bizarre sound you have to make.", 
    "You have to know how to spit in the instrument just the", 
    "right way to get the sound out of it.", 
    "I've tried it many times.", 
    "It's really not easy.", 
    "So blowing air is just said in a simple way, but in order to", 
    "get it to resonate, you've got to really know how to hold", 
    "your lips and how to excite that cavity."
