    "WALTER LEWIN: So what I will do now, I will take", 
    "unpolarized light, and I will have this light coming", 
    "straight out of the blackboard perpendicular to you with", 
    "strength I 0 And here is one of my polarizers.", 
    "And the light that comes through here is linearly", 
    "polarized in this direction.", 
    "And so we already know that 1/2 I 0 will come through if", 
    "it is an ideal polarizer and it is", 
    "polarized in this direction.", 
    "I take a second sheet, an identical one.", 
    "I put it also in the plane of the blackboard, but I rotated", 
    "it over an angle theta.", 
    "So here is now a second sheet which has a preferred", 
    "direction of polarization in this direction, and the angle", 
    "is rotated over an angle theta.", 
    "So between this one and this one is an angle theta.", 
    "And so you can now immediately tell what the intensity of the", 
    "light is that come through this second polarizer.", 
    "It must, of course, be polarized in this direction", 
    "because that is the allowed direction of polarization for", 
    "that second sheet.", 
    "And the intensity must now be 1/2 I 0 because", 
    "that's what comes in.", 
    "And then I have to multiply it by the", 
    "cosine squared of theta.", 
    "I don't have to average it now over all angles because", 
    "there's only one value of theta between this sheet and", 
    "this sheet.", 
    "So this is now the new intensity, and it's all", 
    "polarized in this direction.", 
    "And this law whereby the light intensity is reduced by the", 
    "factor cosine squared theta is known as Malus' Law.", 
    "Malus' Law.", 
    "If theta were 30 degrees, the light intensity here would be", 
    "1/2 I 0 times the cosine squared of 30", 
    "degrees, which is 0.75.", 
    "If theta were zero degrees, that means that this sheet is", 
    "in the same direction as this one.", 
    "If everything were ideal, 1/2 I 0 will get through the", 
    "second sheet.", 
    "If theta is 90 degrees, then nothing will get through", 
    "because the cosine of 90 degrees is zero.", 
    "We call that cross-polarizers.", 
    "If you cross them like this, no light will get through.", 
    "Now before I demonstrate this, I have to be honest with you", 
    "because the idea of reducing the energy of individual", 
    "photons by reducing their electric field strength as I", 
    "did is a cheat.", 
    "A light photon has a well-defined energy which", 
    "depends uniquely on the frequency of the light.", 
    "Blue light has a higher frequency than red light.", 
    "So blue light has a higher energy than red light.", 
    "And when you send blue light through a polarizer, the way I", 
    "did here, it either comes through or it", 
    "doesn't come through.", 
    "But if it does come through, it is still blue light.", 
    "There is no such thing as a reduction in energy.", 
    "Whereas, this reduction by cosine theta would imply that", 
    "the energy goes down and that would imply then that there", 
    "will be a color change, that it would no longer be blue.", 
    "And that's not the case.", 
    "If you want to treat this properly, you have to do it in", 
    "a quantum mechanical way.", 
    "The interesting thing is that if you use quantum mechanics", 
    "you find exactly the same law.", 
    "You find also Malus' Law.", 
    "So the law is OK even though the derivation is not kosher.", 
    "Now I want you to get out of your envelope one of your", 
    "green plates which is a linear polarizer.", 
    "This is the kind of plate that you have.", 
    "You have three in there.", 
    "Only take one out.", 
    "These two lights shining on me, unpolarized light.", 
    "So the light that comes to you now is unpolarized.", 
    "I'm now going to hold in front of my face this polarizer.", 
    "So the light that comes through is linearly polarized", 
    "in this direction.", 
    "And you are going to play the role of the second polarizer.", 
    "Close one eye.", 
    "Put your polarizer in front of your eye and rotate it.", 
    "And you'll see a huge difference in light intensity.", 
    "If you cross-polarized with me, then you can't see me.", 
    "That may make you very happy.", 
    "But keep in mind if you can't see me, I", 
    "can't see you either.", 
    "So rotate it around and convince yourself that this", 
    "light that reaches you is now indeed linearly polarized.", 
    "And when you rotate around your polarimeters--", 
    "we call them polarimeters.", 
    "We call them polarizers--", 
    "you can see me either or you cannot see me at all.", 
    "And there's anything and everything in between.", 
    "Very well.", 
    "There's a second way that we can produce 100% linearly", 
    "polarized light.", 
    "And we can do that by reflecting unpolarized light", 
    "off a dielectric, for instance, water or glass.", 
    "None of this follows from Snell's Law.", 
    "Snell's Law was 250 years before Maxwell.", 
    "Polarization wasn't even known in the days of Snell.", 
    "But Maxwell's equations allow you to properly deal with", 
    "refraction and reflection including the polarization.", 
    "And I will make no attempt to derive this for you in detail.", 
    "That's really part of 8.03 if you ever take it.", 
    "But I will present you with some results so that you can", 
    "at least appreciate the far-reaching consequences of", 
    "the reflection in which we can produce 100% polarized light.", 
    "Suppose I have unpolarized light coming in here medium 1", 
    "index of refraction n 1, medium 2 index of", 
    "refraction n 2.", 
    "It's coming in at an incident angle of theta 1 unpolarized.", 
    "Some of it is reflected.", 
    "And this angle is also theta 1 as we discussed earlier.", 
    "And some of it is refracted into this medium, and this", 
    "angle, we'll call theta 2.", 
    "So this light unpolarized comes in,", 
    "reflects and refracts.", 
    "If you want to use Maxwell's equations, at the axis where", 
    "everything is happening, right here at the surface between", 
    "the two, you will have to decompose the incoming light,", 
    "the electric field vector, in two directions.", 
    "And one direction is perpendicular to the", 
    "blackboard, so this is the E vector, and the other", 
    "direction is in the blackboard.", 
    "You will have to do the same here.", 
    "And you have to do the same here.", 
    "And if you look at this decomposition, then notice", 
    "that both components--", 
    "this component as well as this component--", 
    "is perpendicular to the direction of propagation.", 
    "That is always a must with traveling", 
    "electric magnetic waves.", 
    "You see the same here.", 
    "This component and this are both perpendicular to the", 
    "reflected beam.", 
    "This component and this are both perpendicular to the", 
    "refracted beam.", 
    "This one, the one perpendicular to the", 
    "blackboard, we normally give the symbol perpendicular.", 
    "We call this the incident plane.", 
    "The plane through the incident light and normal to the", 
    "surface we call that the incident plane.", 
    "In this case, that is the blackboard.", 
    "We call this the perpendicular component, and we call this", 
    "the parallel component.", 
    "And this is, of course, the incident beam.", 
    "So this one we call the perpendicular component.", 
    "This one we call the parallel component.", 
    "And this is now of the refracted beam.", 
    "This is the parallel component.", 
    "This is the perpendicular component of", 
    "the reflected beam.", 
    "The incident light is not polarized in this sense.", 
    "So if you average, then there is no preferred direction of", 
    "the electric field.", 
    "That means then that in this representation the strengths", 
    "of this component and the strength of this component", 
    "must be exactly equal.", 
    "Because if one were stronger than the other, then it", 
    "wouldn't be unpolarized.", 
    "Then that would be on average a preferred direction.", 
    "So this component has the same strength as that component for", 
    "the incoming light.", 
    "What Maxwell's equations now can do for us--", 
    "it's a lot of work.", 
    "You may see it in 8.03--", 
    "it can relate the parallel component in reflection with", 
    "the parallel component of incident, the parallel", 
    "component of refraction with the parallel", 
    "component of incident.", 
    "So it gives you two relations, two equations.", 
    "It can also relate the perpendicular component of", 
    "reflection with this perpendicular component and", 
    "the perpendicular component in", 
    "refraction with this component.", 
    "So you get four equations.", 
    "If this light that comes in is unpolarized, the strength of", 
    "this component is the same as this one.", 
    "In general, you will see if you apply these four equations", 
    "that that's no longer the case here.", 
    "They're no longer the same intensity, and they're no", 
    "longer the same intensity here.", 
    "That means this reflected light and the refracted light", 
    "have now become partially polarized.", 
    "I will only give you the relation, one", 
    "of those four equations.", 
    "I will only address today the parallel component of the", 
    "incident beam and the parallel component of", 
    "the reflected beam.", 
    "And I don't imagine that anyone of you will try to", 
    "remember that equation.", 
    "I don't either.", 
    "I have to look it up every time that I deal with this.", 
    "So E 0 which always represents then the maximum possible", 
    "value of the electric field of the parallel component of the", 
    "reflected beam, that's the one that I'm after.", 
    "I'm going to make polarized light by reflecting this E 0,", 
    "the parallel component of the incident beam, times--", 
    "this depends now on the angle of incidence and on the", 
    "indices of refraction--", 
    "is going to be n 1 times the cosine of theta 2, minus n 2", 
    "times the cosine of theta 1--", 
    "believe it or not, all of this follows from Maxwell--", 
    "divided by n 1 times the cosine of theta 2, plus n 2", 
    "times the cosine of theta 1.", 
    "And if you apply Snell's Law, you can", 
    "simplify this equation.", 
    "In this case, it will help us.", 
    "And so you get minus E 0 parallel incidence.", 
    "And now you get here the tangent of theta 1 minus theta", 
    "2, divided by the tangent of theta 1 plus theta 2.", 
    "So these two equations are identical though that may not", 
    "be obvious to you.", 
    "Certainly not obvious to me either.", 
    "But if you substitute Snell's Law in here, you can show that", 
    "these two are the same."
