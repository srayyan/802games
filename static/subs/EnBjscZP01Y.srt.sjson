    "WALTER LEWIN: His idea was that through the lightning", 
    "rod, you would get a continuous discharge, corona", 
    "discharge, between the clouds and the building.", 
    "And therefore, you would keep the potential difference low.", 
    "And so there would be no danger of lightning.", 
    "And so he advised King George III to put these sharp points", 
    "on the royal palace and on the powder houses, storage places", 
    "for ammunition.", 
    "There was a lot of opposition against Franklin.", 
    "They argued that a lightning rod will only attract", 
    "lightning and that the effect of the discharge lowering the", 
    "potential difference would be insignificant.", 
    "But nevertheless, the king followed Franklin's advice.", 
    "And after the sharp rods, the lightning rods, were placed,", 
    "there was a lightning bolt that hit one of the ammunition", 
    "places at Pearl Fleet.", 
    "But there was very little damage.", 
    "And so we now know that on the one hand, the discharge is", 
    "indeed insignificant.", 
    "And so the opposition was correct.", 
    "And in fact you do attract lightning, unlike what", 
    "Franklin had hoped for.", 
    "However, if your lightning rod is thick enough that it can", 
    "handle the high current, which is 10,000 or 100,000 amperes,", 
    "then the current will go through the lightning rod.", 
    "And therefore, there will not be any explosions.", 
    "It will not hit the building.", 
    "So it will be confined to the lightning rod.", 
    "And so it worked but for different reasons than", 
    "Franklin had in mind.", 
    "But he had the right intuition.", 
    "He was a very great scientist and great statesman.", 
    "And so his lightning rod survived up to today.", 
    "So now I want to return to the Van de Graaff and show you", 
    "some of the things that we have discussed.", 
    "And the first thing that I would want to do is create", 
    "some sparks.", 
    "I run the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And I will approach it with this small", 
    "sphere, small radius.", 
    "And as I come closer and closer, the electric field", 
    "will build up here.", 
    "And then I would predict that if sparks fly over, that they", 
    "will go between the Van de Graaff and this sphere.", 
    "This sphere is grounded.", 
    "And so any current that will flow will flow not through", 
    "Walter Lewin, but will go through the ground.", 
    "So there's no danger that anything will happen to me, at", 
    "least not yet.", 
    "You already hear some cracking noise.", 
    "That means there are already sparks flying", 
    "around inside there.", 
    "It's very hard to avoid.", 
    "There are always some sharp edges in there", 
    "that we cannot remove.", 
    "This is not an ideal instrument.", 
    "But I still think I will be able to show you some sparks", 
    "by coming closer.", 
    "[POP]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: There we go.", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: So what you think is only one spark may", 
    "well be several like these return strokes the way I", 
    "described with lightning.", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: So what you're seeing here now is that the", 
    "electric field locally has become larger than 3 million", 
    "volts per meter.", 
    "And then you go into this discharge", 
    "phenomena that we described.", 
    "And that gives you the lightning.", 
    "[POP]", 
    "[POP]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: What I will do now is I would like you to", 
    "experience, although it may not be so fascinating for you,", 
    "to experience a corona discharge between a very sharp", 
    "point that I have here, extremely sharp,", 
    "and the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And the only way that I can convince you that there is", 
    "indeed going to be a discharge between this point and the Van", 
    "de Graaff is by approaching the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And this cracking noise that you hear now will disappear.", 
    "And the reason why it will disappear is that if I get a", 
    "corona discharge between the tip and the Van de Graaff, it", 
    "will drain current.", 
    "It will lower the potential.", 
    "And so that cracking noise will disappear.", 
    "So the sparks, which are now flying over,", 
    "won't fly over anymore.", 
    "You will not be able to see the light.", 
    "It's too much light here.", 
    "Although I can probably see at the tip here, this blue light.", 
    "So I'm going to approach the Van de Graaff now.", 
    "It's almost as if I had a lightning rod.", 
    "And I'm not worried at all because if any current starts", 
    "flowing, it will go through this rod, which is like a", 
    "lightning rod through the earth.", 
    "So I'm not worried at all.", 
    "I'm just very brave, very courageous", 
    "approaching the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And I want you to listen to that cracking noise.", 
    "That cracking noise will disappear when I'm going to", 
    "draw a current through this sharp point.", 
    "Oh boy, there I go.", 
    "And the cracking stops.", 
    "And I can actually see here some", 
    "glowing discharge, blueish.", 
    "It will be impossible for you to see.", 
    "I can come closer.", 
    "I'm not worried.", 
    "And so I'm draining charge now off the Van de Graaff, thereby", 
    "lowering the potential of the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And so these crazy sparks that occur here", 
    "can no longer occur.", 
    "But now they will.", 
    "Can you hear them?", 
    "And now you can't.", 
    "If I were crazy, then I would develop a corona discharge", 
    "between the Van de Graaff and myself.", 
    "One way I could do that is by approaching it with my", 
    "fingertips, as I mentioned earlier.", 
    "But that may be a little bit too dangerous because I may", 
    "draw a spark, which is the last thing that", 
    "I would want today.", 
    "However, a coronal discharge using these tinsels may be", 
    "less dangerous.", 
    "So I get a continuous flow of current, which now,", 
    "unfortunately, doesn't go through the lightning rod but", 
    "now it goes straight through my body.", 
    "And I can assure you that I can feel that.", 
    "It's probably a very low current.", 
    "It may be only a few microamperes.", 
    "But it's not funny.", 
    "It's not pleasant.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: But anything for my students, what the hell.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: So there we go.", 
    "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you see the tinsels.", 
    "I'm now in a corona discharge.", 
    "And I feel the current through my fingers.", 
    "It's continuous discharge now.", 
    "This is St. Elmo's fire.", 
    "[POP]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Ah, there was a spark.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Boy, you got something for your $27,000.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Ah man, OK, so you saw both corona discharge", 
    "and you saw sparks.", 
    "Boy, you were luckier than the first class by the way.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Clearly lightning can be dangerous.", 
    "Lightning can cause a fire.", 
    "It can explode fumes.", 
    "If you gas your car up, just the flow of gasoline can", 
    "charge up the nozzle.", 
    "Friction can charge things up.", 
    "That's why the nozzle is always grounded because a", 
    "spark would cause a major explosion.", 
    "If you fill a balloon with hydrogen, then the flow of", 
    "hydrogen is friction, can charge up the balloon, and a", 
    "spark can then ignite the hydrogen.", 
    "And this has led to a classic tragic accident.", 
    "It's a long time ago.", 
    "But it's so classic that I really have to", 
    "show this to you.", 
    "Hitler was very proud of his large air ships.", 
    "They're named after Count Zeppelin.", 
    "The Germans called them the zeppelins.", 
    "We called them dirigibles or blimps.", 
    "And one of the largest ones that Hitler's Germany ever", 
    "built was the Hindenburg, 803 feet long and seven million", 
    "cubic feet of hydrogen.", 
    "And the Germans couldn't fill their zeppelins with helium", 
    "because they didn't have helium.", 
    "And the Americans were not going to sell them helium, for", 
    "very good reason.", 
    "And so they had to fill them with hydrogen.", 
    "And so the Hindenburg, which was the name of this zeppelin,", 
    "came over in May 1937.", 
    "And when it arrived at Lakehurst in New Jersey, it", 
    "started a gigantic fire.", 
    "It came over in 35 hours, Transatlantic.", 
    "And you see here the explosion, May", 
    "6, 7:25 in the afternoon.", 
    "There were 45 passengers on board.", 
    "And 35 died in this fire.", 
    "The speculation was that this may have been sabotaged.", 
    "It's still quite possible although the official inquiry", 
    "board concluded that it was St. Elmo's fire.", 
    "That as the ship moored on this mast here, that", 
    "a spark flew over.", 
    "And that that caused the explosion, the fire.", 
    "And it was the end of dirigibles for Germany.", 
    "Napoleon, also not the nicest man on Earth, had the", 
    "suspicion when many of his soldiers got sick in Egypt", 
    "that this was the result of marsh gas.", 
    "And they suspected that this bad air that they could smell", 
    "when they were near marshes that that was the", 
    "cause of the disease.", 
    "Bad air in French is mal air.", 
    "And so they called the disease malaria.", 
    "And so the way that they tested the air to make sure", 
    "that the soldiers wouldn't get malaria was to build a small", 
    "gun, which was like so.", 
    "This was a conducting barrel.", 
    "And they would let some of this marsh gas in the gun and", 
    "put a cork on here, close it off.", 
    "And here was a sharp pin.", 
    "This pin was completely insulated from the barrel,", 
    "conducting barrel.", 
    "And then they would put some charge on here so that this", 
    "spark would fly over there.", 
    "This is really the precursor of the spark plug that we have", 
    "in our cars.", 
    "It's no different.", 
    "And so if indeed there was then this marsh gas in there,", 
    "there might be an explosion.", 
    "And that was a warning then that there may be danger for", 
    "the soldiers.", 
    "Well, this morning I was walking through the building.", 
    "I was in Lobby 7.", 
    "And I smelled some funny, it was a funny smell.", 
    "And I was just wondering whether perhaps--", 
    "who knows, at MIT anything can happen--", 
    "whether there was some gas there that shouldn't be there.", 
    "And so I brought my special gun, which is here, which is", 
    "built after Napoleon.", 
    "And you see here this little sphere.", 
    "And I opened it up, the cork here, and let some of that air", 
    "in, Building 7.", 
    "And then I decided that you and I will do the test and see", 
    "whether perhaps there was some gas there that", 
    "may cause some danger.", 
    "So I would have to cause a discharge then inside the", 
    "barrel here.", 
    "I can try to do that by combing my hair.", 
    "But that may not be sufficient amount of charge.", 
    "So I can always make sure that there will be a spark inside", 
    "that gun and use this disk, which has a little bit more", 
    "charge on it.", 
    "So here is then this Lobby 7 gas inside.", 
    "Now, of course, there's one possibility that there was", 
    "nothing wrong with the air.", 
    "In which case, you will see nothing.", 
    "And there is another possibility, that the air", 
    "wasn't kosher enough and that you may see", 
    "here a small bloop.", 
    "And since it's going to be very small at best, you have", 
    "to be very quiet.", 
    "Otherwise, you won't hear anything.", 
    "And so let's first try now with my comb, I have my comb", 
    "here, to see whether I can generate a", 
    "spark inside this barrel.", 
    "And that may not work because I'm not sure that I get enough", 
    "charge on this comb.", 
    "No, that doesn't work at all.", 
    "Well, let's see whether we can use this instrument.", 
    "[BOOM]", 
    "STUDENTS: Whoa.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Well, I sure hope that", 
    "we won't get malaria.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: See you tomorrow.", 
    "[APPLAUSE]"
