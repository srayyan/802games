    "WALTER LEWIN: And I can demonstrate that to you.", 
    "I have here a pendulum.", 
    "The pendulum is a conducting copper plate, like so, which", 
    "I'm going to swing between magnetic", 
    "poles, which are here.", 
    "I'm going to swing it in this direction.", 
    "In fact, I have two pendulums, one whereby this is solid", 
    "copper, and I have another one whereby it is", 
    "slotted like teeth.", 
    "If I'm going to oscillate this one in the magnetic field,", 
    "you're going to get current there, eddy current, sometimes", 
    "clockwise, sometimes counter-clockwise depending", 
    "upon how the magnetic flux through", 
    "that surface is changing.", 
    "Whether it moves into the magnetic field or whether it", 
    "moves out of the magnetic field, it will always oppose", 
    "its motion, and so it will damp.", 
    "You will see that.", 
    "And it's at the expense of kinetic energy, heat will be", 
    "produced in this copper.", 
    "If you do it with something like this, the damping thing", 
    "will be substantially less, not zero, but substantially", 
    "less, because now if there is an EMF that wants to drive a", 
    "current, this current has to go through this opening, which", 
    "is air which has a huge resistance.", 
    "And remember, power is EMF times I, and is I squared R,", 
    "and if the current's extremely low because the resistance is", 
    "so absurdly high then you don't dissipate much power,", 
    "and so there's not much damping.", 
    "And I can show that to you.", 
    "By the way, this magnetic damping is used sometimes for", 
    "scales that you weigh yourself on, so that it doesn't", 
    "oscillate for too long, so it damps very quickly.", 
    "So you're going to see the oscillations there, and it's", 
    "going to be a little dark, but that's the best way that I can", 
    "make you see it.", 
    "Turn on the power.", 
    "So you see there, the loop gives you a little light, and", 
    "first I will oscillate it without any magnetic fields.", 
    "I can power this magnet because it has solenoids.", 
    "So we'll just oscillate it.", 
    "No magnetic fields.", 
    "Give you a feeling how it oscillates.", 
    "So this gives you an idea of how it oscillates, and now I", 
    "will turn on the magnetic field.", 
    "Now, just like going into mud.", 
    "I'll do it again.", 
    "Oh, hitting the magnetic poles.", 
    "We don't want that.", 
    "Now, amazing, isn't it?", 
    "And it doesn't matter whether it goes in or", 
    "whether it goes out.", 
    "And now, I will use the one with the teeth, and you will", 
    "see there is damping, but it's substantially less.", 
    "So this is without magnetic field.", 
    "And now, with.", 
    "Now.", 
    "You can see there's damping, but it's nowhere nearly as", 
    "much as there was on the one that didn't have teeth.", 
    "I have here a remarkable example of how", 
    "our economy is run.", 
    "I have there some windings, not just some.", 
    "We don't even know how many thousands copper wire going", 
    "around, going around, going around, going around, is one", 
    "wire, and then there is a light bulb in that loop.", 
    "And here is a magnet.", 
    "We don't know the strength, but I would say it's not more", 
    "than a kilogauss.", 
    "It's probably a little less.", 
    "And when I move this between these poles, magnetic field,", 
    "let's say, is going in this direction.", 
    "I don't know whether it's in this or that.", 
    "I don't know the color code.", 
    "But there is a magnetic field going through here, so there's", 
    "a change in the magnetic flux of this", 
    "surface, very crazy surface.", 
    "If there's 1,000 wires, the surface goes", 
    "1,000 times like this.", 
    "Remember?", 
    "And then there is going to be an induced EMF, and there's", 
    "going to be an induced current.", 
    "And these lights will glow a little.", 
    "If I go in very slowly, you'll just see", 
    "teeny-weeny little lights.", 
    "If I go very fast, then the magnetic flux change is high,", 
    "high EMF, lot of lights.", 
    "So I'll make it darker so that you can see that.", 
    "Oh, we don't want this.", 
    "In fact, we don't need that to display at all.", 
    "So if you can see me, I have it now, and I'm going to bring", 
    "it in the magnetic poles, and I go very slowly.", 
    "I do it now.", 
    "You see?", 
    "I pull out, a little bit of light.", 
    "I go in, a little bit of light.", 
    "I'm right now holding it steady, nothing happens.", 
    "Why?", 
    "Because there's no flux change.", 
    "Magnetic field is very strong now through these loops.", 
    "Faraday doesn't care about how strong it is.", 
    "He only cares about the change.", 
    "I pull it out, little bit of light; put it in, a", 
    "little bit of light.", 
    "Whether I pull in or whether I pull out doesn't matter.", 
    "If I do it very fast, I may be able to generate so much", 
    "current that the bulb may even blow.", 
    "I'll try that because I know you like the", 
    "idea of breaking things.", 
    "We all do.", 
    "You're not alone.", 
    "Let's see whether I managed.", 
    "Yes, I did.", 
    "It's broken, now.", 
    "So you've got something for your money, didn't you?", 
    "That runs our economy.", 
    "Windings conducting windings that are being moved", 
    "forcefully through magnetic fields.", 
    "Faraday was once interviewed by reporters when he came up", 
    "with this law, and they said to him, so what.", 
    "So fine, so you move a winding through a magnetic field, and", 
    "so you get a little bit of electricity.", 
    "So what?", 
    "And his answer was, \"Someday, you will tax", 
    "it.\" And he was right.", 
    "He had vision.", 
    "The reporters didn't.", 
    "Part of life.", 
    "I can show you another striking", 
    "example of magnetic braking.", 
    "I have here a magnet, which I can also power with solenoids,", 
    "and I have here two rings.", 
    "One ring, which is complete in the sense that it's like so,", 
    "conducting ring--", 
    "I drop it through the magnetic field, and as the flux is", 
    "changing, the eddy current will flow in such a direction", 
    "that it will oppose the change.", 
    "And so it could either be in this", 
    "direction or in this direction.", 
    "I don't know, but it will flow to oppose the change.", 
    "And so as it enters the magnetic field, when the flux", 
    "is increasing, it will be damped.", 
    "When it is in the magnetic field and the flux is not", 
    "changing very much anymore, there will be no damping.", 
    "But when it comes out of the magnetic field, the flux is", 
    "changing again through the surface, it", 
    "will be damped again.", 
    "And you can see that.", 
    "And then I will throw through there another ring, which is", 
    "the same dimensions, but this ring has an opening here.", 
    "Air, the resistance is huge, so the current that is going", 
    "to flow, this eddy current, is way lower because the", 
    "resistance is so high.", 
    "And so there is no power dissipation because I is so", 
    "low, and so there's no heat produced at the expense of", 
    "kinetic energy, so there's no damping.", 
    "There's no strong force that opposes it, and I", 
    "can show you both.", 
    "And for this I need the DC power on again, and we're", 
    "going to project it there on the wall.", 
    "I have to wait and see that I get my carbon arc up.", 
    "There it comes, so we're going to project this slot, which is", 
    "the opening between the pole tips, on the wall there.", 
    "Light off, light off, all off.", 
    "You see it there?", 
    "This is that magnet.", 
    "And here comes the ring, the ring that is going to be", 
    "decelerated heavily when it goes in.", 
    "Watch it.", 
    "Oh, small detail.", 
    "I forgot to turn the power on.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Darn it.", 
    "There we go, power goes on.", 
    "Actually, you see now--", 
    "I did that purposefully.", 
    "You've seen now how fast it should go if there is no", 
    "magnetic field, so now there is a magnetic field.", 
    "Now, did you notice the three phases?", 
    "You get damping, and then when it is right in the magnetic", 
    "field, when there's very little flux change, then it", 
    "picks up speed again.", 
    "And then it slows down again.", 
    "Watch it again.", 
    "Now, the one with the slot.", 
    "Amazing, huh?", 
    "Now, once more, the one without the slot.", 
    "Magnetic damping, all of that, result of eddy currents.", 
    "All of that, result of Faraday's law.", 
    "Heat is produced at the expense of kinetic energy.", 
    "So if I summarize, then when we create an induced EMF, and", 
    "we run a current, we either have to change magnetic fields", 
    "in time, or we have to change the area in time, or we have", 
    "to change the angle theta.", 
    "But we must make a change in the magnetic flux through an", 
    "open surface, and the energy that is dissipated must come", 
    "from somewhere."
