    "PROFESSOR LEWIN: And therefore, I can now tell you", 
    "where the maxima will lie on that screen away from the", 
    "center line, which I call 0.", 
    "That is now, when x of n is L times the sine of theta in", 
    "small angle approximation.", 
    "So this is approximately L times n lambda divided by d.", 
    "And for the same reason, you will get here destructive", 
    "interference where x of n is going to be L times 2n plus 1", 
    "times lambda divided by 2d.", 
    "That is simple geometry.", 
    "So now, we have all the ingredients here on the", 
    "blackboard.", 
    "And I'm going to leave it there for", 
    "the rest of the lecture.", 
    "Whenever we're going to do an experiment with two sources", 
    "which are in phase at the same frequency, you can predict the", 
    "directions of maxima and minima.", 
    "And you can even predict the linear separation if you know", 
    "how far away you are from these sources.", 
    "And the first demonstration that I'm going", 
    "to do is with sound.", 
    "We have here two loudspeakers.", 
    "And the distance between those two loudspeakers that we're", 
    "going to do it with sound; d is 1.5 meters, that's a given.", 
    "And the frequency is 3,000 hertz.", 
    "The wavelengths, therefore, lambda equals v", 
    "divided by the frequency.", 
    "The speed of sound is about 340 meters per second divided", 
    "by 3,000 is about 0.113 meters.", 
    "So the wavelength is about 11.3 centimeters.", 
    "I can now calculate everyone who is sitting here-- whoosh,", 
    "right in the middle, through this whole plane--", 
    "will have a maximum of sound.", 
    "And then when we go away at angle theta, some will, again,", 
    "have maxima.", 
    "And we go further away theta; again, maxima.", 
    "And in between will be the minima.", 
    "And I'm going to calculate where they fall", 
    "in the lecture hall.", 
    "The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to give you", 
    "n as in \"Nancy\" and calculate that angle theta of n.", 
    "And I will do it for the maxima.", 
    "In other words, I'm going to use constructive interference.", 
    "Now, you see that the sine of theta n is n", 
    "lambda divided by d.", 
    "That's the equation I use.", 
    "When n is 0, the angle is 0.", 
    "That is 0 angle.", 
    "Everyone here will hear a maximum.", 
    "When n is 1--", 
    "you may want to check that at home--", 
    "I find that angle of 4.3 degrees.", 
    "And when n is 2, the angle is about double that.", 
    "It's about 8.7 degrees.", 
    "And when n is 3, should be close to 13 degrees; 13.1.", 
    "In case, you would take n is 10--", 
    "so I skip a few--", 
    "you get about 49 degrees.", 
    "This is where the maximum fall.", 
    "And so it is going to be a maximum here.", 
    "And then 4.3 degrees away is again a maximum.", 
    "But surely, we would like to know how far you, in the", 
    "audience, will have to move in order to go from a", 
    "maximum to a minimum.", 
    "And so the way you have to think of this is that if I", 
    "make here a picture of the lecture hall, if here are", 
    "these two sources, you are at a distance L away from here.", 
    "Some of you are 5 meters away.", 
    "Some are 10 meters away.", 
    "Some are 15 meters away, all the way to", 
    "the back of the audience.", 
    "And you want to know, where are you", 
    "going to hear the maxima?", 
    "I call this x1.", 
    "I call this x2.", 
    "And I call this x3.", 
    "And this is 0.", 
    "So this is the meaning of theta1.", 
    "And this is the meaning of theta3.", 
    "And this angle here would be theta2.", 
    "That's the meaning of these angles.", 
    "And so I can calculate, , now, how far you have to move", 
    "depending on [? where ?]", 
    "L is, to here to go from one maximum in", 
    "sound to another maximum.", 
    "And we raise the--", 
    "a little more.", 
    "And so I will show you now some of", 
    "the results for maxima.", 
    "So I only go now for constructive interference.", 
    "And I have done this for three different distances; those of", 
    "you are 5 meters away from me, 10 meters away from me, and 15", 
    "meters away from me.", 
    "And what you see on the left side is going to be x.", 
    "That is the linear separation.", 
    "And these were in meters.", 
    "Forgive me, but I will do these in centimeters.", 
    "And this is x1.", 
    "If you are 5 meters away from me, you will have--", 
    "I will put x1 a little lower than I have it now.", 
    "You will see, shortly, why I put it a little lower.", 
    "x1, this is about 38 centimeters.", 
    "So the linear separation from one to the next is 38", 
    "centimeters.", 
    "And you're 10 meters away, it's double that.", 
    "That's no surprise, 76 centimeters.", 
    "And if you're 15 meters away, it is 113 centimeters.", 
    "And then x2, which is the position where you have", 
    "another maximum, would be at 76 centimeters.", 
    "And it would be at 152 centimeters.", 
    "And it would be at 228 centimeters, if you're 15", 
    "meters away from me.", 
    "So the minima will fall almost exactly in between.", 
    "And so the minima, where in an ideal case there", 
    "is no sound at all--", 
    "sound [? per ?] sound gives silence, think about it, sound", 
    "[? per ?] sound will give silence--", 
    "will be when you are roughly at 19", 
    "centimeters, half of this.", 
    "This will be 38 centimeters, half of this.", 
    "And here will be something, like 57 centimeters.", 
    "And you can calculate what these values are.", 
    "They are exactly in between.", 
    "And so the conclusion is, that if you are 5", 
    "meters away from me--", 
    "you are near the center line, but you can also be a little", 
    "bit in this direction--", 
    "that the separation between bright sound, loud sound which", 
    "is always at 0, of course, in the middle, to silence is 19", 
    "centimeters.", 
    "And then you move another 19 centimeters, and then you hear", 
    "a loud sound.", 
    "If you are, however, 10 meters away from me, just past the", 
    "cameras, then you have to move 38 centimeters to go from loud", 
    "sound to silence.", 
    "And if you're all the way in the audience, in the back of", 
    "the audience, it's more like 60 centimeters.", 
    "And this is what we're going to do now together.", 
    "I want you all to stand up.", 
    "And I'm going to make you listen to 3,000 hertz.", 
    "And what I want you to do when I turn on the two", 
    "loudspeakers, I want you to move your head very slowly and", 
    "try to find locations where you hear silence.", 
    "The position of silence is extremely well-defined.", 
    "So don't go too fast, you'll miss it.", 
    "Also, keep in mind that there are reflections of the sound", 
    "from the walls and from the blackboard.", 
    "And so the pattern that I have", 
    "calculated here is not perfect.", 
    "But you will see that there will be locations where sound", 
    "[? per ?] sound will give you silence.", 
    "[SUSTAINED RINGING TONE]", 
    "PROFESSOR LEWIN: You are a couple of lousy scientists.", 
    "You are a couple of lousy scientists if the separation", 
    "between a lot of sound and silence is 19 centimeters.", 
    "That's about the separation of your ears, you dummies.", 
    "So one ear could be at a maximum, the other ear could", 
    "be at the minimum.", 
    "So at least, close one ear.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "[SUSTAINED RINGING TONE]", 
    "PROFESSOR LEWIN: Go very slowly.", 
    "[RINGING TONE GETTING LOUDER]", 
    "PROFESSOR LEWIN: Who has found clear locations where the", 
    "sound is nearly 0 or practically 0?", 
    "Most of you.", 
    "And you certainly can hear if you move that there's an", 
    "enormous difference in sound intensity.", 
    "So again, who has found locations, whereby, you", 
    "clearly say, this is practically silence?", 
    "Ah, you see them all the way to the back.", 
    "And the separation, how far you have to move depends on", 
    "how far you are away from me.", 
    "Sit down, again.", 
    "Young was a sound engineer.", 
    "And as a sound engineer, he was very familiar with the", 
    "interference of sound.", 
    "He knew that sound and sound can make silence.", 
    "And so in 1801, he demonstrated in a convincing", 
    "way that light plus light can create darkness.", 
    "That would be the nail in the coffin that would demonstrate", 
    "uniquely that light are indeed waves.", 
    "And there was still this controversy between Huygens", 
    "and Newton, as you perhaps remember.", 
    "Newton wanted light to be particles, but Huygens wanted", 
    "them to be waves.", 
    "And the way that Young did his experiments is as follows.", 
    "He had a screen.", 
    "Don't think of it as this big.", 
    "You're talking now about extraordinarily small", 
    "dimensions.", 
    "You will understand shortly how small.", 
    "And in this screen are two openings, two pinholes.", 
    "And light is coming from the left.", 
    "And think of light as being plain waves.", 
    "They reach these two openings.", 
    "And these two openings, according to Huygens, will", 
    "produce circular waves; spherical waves, of course,", 
    "three-dimensionally.", 
    "These openings become Huygens' sources.", 
    "And spherical waves will", 
    "propagate out in this direction.", 
    "And so now, we have exactly the situation that we", 
    "had with our sound.", 
    "Now, if all works well, there should be directions of theta", 
    "away from this line where you see darkness; and other", 
    "directions where you see bright lights.", 
    "And we are going to do it in a way we have the luxury of", 
    "laser beams, so we have very strong light sources which", 
    "Young did not have.", 
    "The way we are going to do it, we have a slide which is", 
    "completely black.", 
    "But with a razor blade, two lines have been drawn on it.", 
    "And so I will draw all these lines as white lines.", 
    "But they're really openings.", 
    "And there is another one here.", 
    "And the separation between these lines, d is 0.088", 
    "millimeters; less than a tenth of a millimeter.", 
    "When you look at them, you cannot even see that", 
    "there are two lines.", 
    "Our laser beam has a diameter of about 3 millimeters, which", 
    "is 30 times larger than this distance, 30 times larger.", 
    "So what I'm going to show you now that this is our laser", 
    "beam, is not to scale.", 
    "The laser beam is much larger than that.", 
    "Young's exact setup was somewhat different from my", 
    "drawing on the blackboard.", 
    "But my drawing simplifies Young's setup and is,", 
    "therefore, easier to understand.", 
    "And so the light will go through some parts of these", 
    "slots as far as our laser beam reaches.", 
    "And we are now capable of predicting when we go in to", 
    "project it there, here are the two slots, which are like so.", 
    "And so you're going to get interference patterns in these", 
    "directions' theta.", 
    "And we can calculate what the position x is going to be", 
    "there between the maxima.", 
    "And so if that is the screen and if this is x equals 0 and", 
    "if this is x1 and this is x2 and, of course, the whole", 
    "thing is symmetric, you can always go in the opposite", 
    "direction; you can now calculate.", 
    "And you have all the tools.", 
    "I did it for you in great detail using sound.", 
    "But you have all the tools to do it now.", 
    "You know d.", 
    "I'm going to tell you what lambda is.", 
    "It's 6,328 angstroms.", 
    "And one angstrom is 10 to the minus 10 meters.", 
    "So you can calculate all the direction theta for which", 
    "there are maxima and for which there are minima.", 
    "Minima means light plus light gives darkness--", 
    "an amazing concept.", 
    "And you can then-- if you know the distance from here to the", 
    "screen, which is L-- you can calculate what the separation", 
    "is as we see it on the screen.", 
    "And L is roughly 10 meters, maybe 11.", 
    "But that's not so important."
