    "WALTER LEWIN: And this is what we call the diffraction", 
    "limitation on angular resolution.", 
    "It doesn't matter whether you have a pinhole or whether you", 
    "have a lens, circular lens that we use with telescopes.", 
    "Or whether you have concave mirrors, which we use with", 
    "telescopes.", 
    "In all cases are you always stuck with the idea at best,", 
    "that's the best you can ever do.", 
    "That is the angular separation that theta--", 
    "I call it here the theta one--", 
    "is that 1.2 lambda divided by a.", 
    "And that is then in radians.", 
    "If you take a lens which has a diameter a of about 20", 
    "centimeters, then that translates into a theta 1 of", 
    "about half an arc second for 5,000 angstroms.", 
    "So I take lambda 5,000 angstroms.", 
    "Remember, an angstrom is 10 to the -10 meters.", 
    "So theta 1 then becomes half an arc second.", 
    "0.5 arc seconds.", 
    "An arc minute is 1/60 over the arc degree, and an arc second", 
    "is 60 times lower than that.", 
    "And so if a were 2.4 meters telescope, 2.4 meter", 
    "telescope, that's a real biggie, then theta 1 would be", 
    "approximately 1/25 of an arc second.", 
    "So the larger you make your telescope, the better angular", 
    "resolution you would have.", 
    "This angular resolution is 12 times better than this one,", 
    "because a is 12 times larger.", 
    "In both cases, and in what follows I have ignored the", 
    "factor 1.2.", 
    "So now you may think that if you take a 2.4 meter telescope", 
    "on the ground, and you look at stars, that two start equally", 
    "bright, you'll be able to tell them apart if they are farther", 
    "away from each other than 1/25 of an arc second.", 
    "That is not true.", 
    "On the contrary, it is very bad.", 
    "You can't even tell them apart often when they are half a", 
    "second apart.", 
    "And the reason for that is not that the diffraction", 
    "limitation is going to kill you, but the reason is that", 
    "the air is always turbulent.", 
    "And it is the turbulence on the air that makes the image,", 
    "the diffraction limited image which itself is very small,", 
    "move around on your photographic plates.", 
    "It moves it around in a matter of 10 seconds over an area", 
    "which itself could be as large as one second.", 
    "Astronomers call that seeing.", 
    "And so when you look at your picture, the whole star is", 
    "smeared out over an area which is an angular size 1 arc", 
    "second, or maybe half an arc second at best.", 
    "So you can never achieve this from the ground.", 
    "So all telescopes from the ground, without exception, can", 
    "do at best half an arc second.", 
    "They cannot do much better because of the air turbulence.", 
    "And this is now the great thing about the", 
    "Hubble Space Telescope.", 
    "Hubble is up there, or maybe down there.", 
    "Whichever it is.", 
    "I don't know where it is.", 
    "Maybe Jeff here knows where it is.", 
    "But it is somewhere.", 
    "And Hubble has no air.", 
    "And so Hubble doesn't suffer of the air turbulence.", 
    "And so Hubble's mirrors are indeed diffraction limited.", 
    "And Hubble has a mirror which is 2.4 meters diameter.", 
    "And indeed, at at 5,000 Angstrom, I checked that", 
    "yesterday with people at Hubble Space Telescope,", 
    "indeed, Hubble is diffraction limited, and Hubble has an", 
    "angular resolution at 5,000 angstroms, which is about 1/25", 
    "of an arc seconds.", 
    "And at shorter wavelengths, it's even better.", 
    "And at longer wavelengths, it is a little worse.", 
    "And so I would like to show you at least one picture of", 
    "Hubble without going into the details of what you were", 
    "seeing of the astronomy.", 
    "And that's the one that is coming.", 
    "Up it's a very famous picture that Hubble made", 
    "several years ago.", 
    "It is a picture of a supernova explosion.", 
    "John, if we can have the slides.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "You're looking here at an explosion.", 
    "It's called Supernova 1987a, which occurred", 
    "in February of 1987.", 
    "This object is 150,000 lightyears away from us.", 
    "That means the explosion really took place", 
    "150,000 years ago.", 
    "But we saw it for the first time in February '87.", 
    "And without going into the details of what you're looking", 
    "at, which is of course very fascinating, but that's not", 
    "the objective today.", 
    "I want you to appreciate that this distance", 
    "here is 1 arc second.", 
    "And look at the incredible detail that", 
    "Hubble can show you.", 
    "If you took a picture like this with a ground based", 
    "observatory, this whole part would just be one smudge.", 
    "You would not be able to resolve that.", 
    "And that is the power that you see in front of you now over", 
    "diffraction limited telescope, which has a", 
    "diameter of 2.4 meters.", 
    "You get an angular resolution which is very close to 0.04 of", 
    "an arc second.", 
    "The amount of detail that you see is incredible.", 
    "That's the big power, the big reason why this telescope was", 
    "put in orbit to do away with the air turbulence, what the", 
    "astronomers call as seeing, which is always the limitation", 
    "of your angular resolution.", 
    "So in the remaining five minutes, I want to address the", 
    "issue of the angular resolution of your own eye.", 
    "You can now calculate what the ultimate angular resolution is", 
    "of your own eye.", 
    "Because you can estimate what the diameter is of the pupil.", 
    "The opening of your eye.", 
    "Three millimeters, maybe five millimeters,", 
    "a little bit larger.", 
    "At night when it is dark, pupil opens up.", 
    "But we can calculate what this is.", 
    "If I take 4 millimeters, So I put in for a 4 millimeters,", 
    "and if I take a lambda 5,000 angstroms, it's not an", 
    "unreasonable value, then I find that the best idea", 
    "resolution of a human eye half an arc minute.", 
    "Cannot be any better.", 
    "There's no way around it.", 
    "You're always stuck with the diffraction limitation.", 
    "I think, though, that most of you will not be able to see", 
    "with an angular resolution of 1/2 arc minute.", 
    "Most of you are probably in the domain of 1 arc minute.", 
    "It's a little larger than diffraction limited, but it's", 
    "very close to that.", 
    "And that is something that I would like to test.", 
    "Not to see how good your eyes are, but for yourself to get a", 
    "feeling for angular resolution.", 
    "And the way I'm going to do that is as follows.", 
    "We have prepared a box which Marcos is going to reel in", 
    "very shortly, which has two pin holes at the top.", 
    "And these two pin holes are 2.5 millimeters apart.", 
    "And then there are two pin holes which are", 
    "5 millimeters apart.", 
    "And then there two pin holes which are", 
    "10 millimeters apart.", 
    "And then there are two pin holes which are", 
    "15 millimeters apart.", 
    "So maybe we can take a look at that.", 
    "Here it comes.", 
    "Thank you, Marcos.", 
    "Here are two pin holes which are 2 .5 millimeters apart.", 
    "We repeat the whole thing three times.", 
    "And the reason why we do that is so that the different", 
    "angles in the audience, you can probably always see two", 
    "pin holes well.", 
    "What am I going to do now to test the angular", 
    "resolution of your eyes?", 
    "If I make the assumption that your angular resolution is 1", 
    "arc minute, no worse, no better.", 
    "Remember, it can never be better", 
    "than half an arc minute.", 
    "That's non negotiable, but it could be", 
    "worse than 1 arc minute.", 
    "That would mean that all students who are closer than", 
    "nine meters from me should be able to see this as two", 
    "independent light sources.", 
    "Those who are father than nine meters away from me will not", 
    "see these as two sources.", 
    "If they did, their angular resolution would be better", 
    "than one arc minute.", 
    "And all students which are closer than 17 meters will be", 
    "able to say yeah, I see these as two sources.", 
    "And all students which are closer than 34 meters should", 
    "be able to say, yeah, I see these as two sources.", 
    "And so we're now going to make it a little darker.", 
    "And you don't need your gratings.", 
    "You don't need this card.", 
    "I just want you to look at the lights, these light sources,", 
    "and then tell me which you're going to see as two separate", 
    "light sources.", 
    "And that then allows me to tell you very roughly what", 
    "your angular resolution is.", 
    "So try to look at them.", 
    "And so now my first question is who can see the upper,", 
    "either here or there or there, they are the same, who can", 
    "clearly see those as two light sources?", 
    "Come on.", 
    "Come on.", 
    "You don't see them as two?", 
    "Something wrong?", 
    "Are the lights not on?", 
    "You must be kidding.", 
    "Are all of you sick or something?", 
    "Oh man, I have no difficulties at all.", 
    "The upper one is two light sources.", 
    "You've all got to see an eye doctor.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Who sees the second line as two?", 
    "Who sees the third line as two, but not the second?", 
    "You see how interesting, just look around you.", 
    "You see we're moving back in the audience.", 
    "Who can see none of them as two light sources?", 
    "OK, so maybe not, no eye doctors are needed, then.", 
    "Who can only see the third line as two sources?", 
    "Only the third line?", 
    "OK.", 
    "I expect that.", 
    "Maybe your angular resolution is not very--", 
    "do you wear glasses?", 
    "Yeah, I'm asking you.", 
    "So you see the third line as double, and", 
    "not the second line.", 
    "There's nothing to worry about.", 
    "Maybe 2 arc minute resolution.", 
    "So now you have tested your angular resolution.", 
    "When you think of diffraction, it's really an incredibly", 
    "fascinating thing.", 
    "Because what does diffraction actually mean?", 
    "That it is a limitation that is put upon us, on everyone.", 
    "Also God.", 
    "No one can bypass diffraction.", 
    "No matter how hard we try, we can never undo our chains and", 
    "handcuffs that are imposed on us by diffraction.", 
    "And remember, it's all Huygen's fault.", 
    "But let's forgive Huygen, because", 
    "after all, he was Dutch."
