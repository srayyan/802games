    "That was very nice.", 
    "Now you won't have any time to fill out", 
    "your evaluation forms.", 
    "I was going to show you some evidence for", 
    "these binary systems.", 
    "We have these hot spots.", 
    "On the neutron star.", 
    "And as the neutron star rotates, and the axis of", 
    "rotation doesn't coincide with the dipole, magnetic dipole", 
    "axis, you're going to see hot spots, hot spot,", 
    "hot spot, hot spot.", 
    "And that explains then the x-ray pulsations.", 
    "You can also see in some cases x-ray eclipses.", 
    "If the neutron star, as seen from the earth, hides behind", 
    "the donor star which is much bigger, then all the x-rays", 
    "are absorbed.", 
    "And so the x-rays stop completely.", 
    "You go into an x-ray eclipse.", 
    "And a few hours later, you come out of the", 
    "x-ray eclipse again.", 
    "And that's what I would like to show you the evidence for,", 
    "which came in the early '70s with the satellite Uhuru.", 
    "The first slide is the basic idea.", 
    "No, that was right, John.", 
    "John, go back to that picture.", 
    "You see here, this is of course a sketch, this is not", 
    "the real thing.", 
    "Here you see a star, not unlike the sun.", 
    "And then here you see the neutron star-- in some cases a", 
    "black hole.", 
    "And then the matter is being sucked off this star because", 
    "the gravitational force in this direction is larger--", 
    "forms the accretion disc, and ends up on the neutron star.", 
    "And the next slide is then the discovery of the early,", 
    "convincing discovery of a pulsating system-- the", 
    "rotation of the neutron star.", 
    "This time scale here is about 1.25 second.", 
    "And the data are--", 
    "here this is the data.", 
    "Unfortunately in this publication, this very bold", 
    "line dominates almost the data.", 
    "But the idea being very clear that the x-ray signal, this is", 
    "the strength of the X-ray signal.", 
    "This is time--", 
    "one and a quarter seconds.", 
    "It's oscillating one and a quarter second period.", 
    "And that's the rotation of the neutron star.", 
    "And the next slide shows you of the same object.", 
    "It's called Hercules X1.", 
    "You see on a very different time scale, this is days.", 
    "You see that the x-ray eclipse is that the x-rays disappear", 
    "completely when the neutron star goes behind the donor.", 
    "And the orbital period is 1.7 days.", 
    "The x-rays disappear completely.", 
    "And so this picture is well established beyond", 
    "a shadow of a doubt.", 
    "We do know what these objects are.", 
    "With no one is flying balloons anymore, I make all my", 
    "observations nowadays from satellites--", 
    "using European satellites, Japanese satellites, and", 
    "American observatories.", 
    "Lately we have the Rossi Timing Explorer in orbit and", 
    "also Chandra, which is the biggest thing in town.", 
    "Now between 1975 and 1979, we were so fortunate here at MIT", 
    "that we had our own private x-ray observatory.", 
    "It was called asked SAS 3.", 
    "It was a all MIT operation.", 
    "We maneuvered it from my building--", 
    "Center for Space Research, building 37--", 
    "24 hours a day, 365 days per year.", 
    "It was at that time that Josh Grindlay and John Heise had", 
    "discovered using a Dutch satellite, believe it or not,", 
    "they had discovered that one x-ray source showed sudden", 
    "x-ray bursts.", 
    "The x-ray intensity would rise in about a few seconds--", 
    "would become 10, 20, 30 times stronger.", 
    "And then over a time scale of maybe a few minutes, the x-ray", 
    "intensity would peter out again.", 
    "And we had this SAS 3 observatory which ideally", 
    "suited to do research in these x-ray bursts.", 
    "And we discovered within two years,", 
    "eight new burst sources.", 
    "And I think it's fair to say that it's largely due to our", 
    "observational work and also to the theoretical work by", 
    "Professor Joss-- who was at MIT and still is at MIT--", 
    "that we now understand what these x-ray bursts are.", 
    "They are huge nuclear bomb explosions on the surface of a", 
    "neutron star,", 
    "The matter that falls onto the neutron star is largely", 
    "hydrogen and helium.", 
    "But that's the matter of this star.", 
    "And the density and the temperature on the surface of", 
    "the neutron star is so high that you get nuclear reactions", 
    "and three helium, four nuclei can fuse to carbon-12.", 
    "And then energy is released.", 
    "And this nuclear reaction is very unstable--", 
    "is extremely sensitive to the temperature.", 
    "If the temperature goes up, the reaction rate is higher.", 
    "More energy is released.", 
    "Temperature goes up.", 
    "When the temperature goes up the reaction rate goes up.", 
    "And so more and more energy is released.", 
    "And the whole thing gets out of hand.", 
    "You get a thermal nuclear run away, as we call it.", 
    "You see a thermonuclear flash--", 
    "a gigantic bomb explosion on the surface", 
    "of the neutron star.", 
    "These bomb explosions are about 18 orders of magnitude", 
    "more powerful than the most powerful hydrogen bombs that", 
    "we can build on earth.", 
    "So this layer, this flash created layer, goes up in one", 
    "huge bomb explosion.", 
    "And then new material is accreted And a few hours", 
    "later, you will see another bomb explosion.", 
    "You can see several of these x-ray bursts per day.", 
    "The optical counterparts of these stars, these binary", 
    "systems, are very faint.", 
    "But you can see them from the ground, with optical", 
    "observatories from the ground.", 
    "And we had reasons to believe at the time that", 
    "simultaneously with an x-ray burst, you might actually", 
    "observe an optical burst.", 
    "And I'll give you the reasons why we believed that.", 
    "You see here, the neutron star.", 
    "And you see the accretion disc.", 
    "And let us assume that there is an x-ray", 
    "burst going on now.", 
    "These red wiggles is x-rays from the x-ray burst.", 
    "The Earth is in this direction.", 
    "So these x-rays reach the Earth first.", 
    "But there are x-rays which go in this direction.", 
    "They are absorbed by the disk.", 
    "And then the disk heats up to 30,000, 40,000 degrees and", 
    "starts to emit optical light.", 
    "Some of that optical light will go in the", 
    "direction of the Earth.", 
    "And so what this means now is, that there is a delay between", 
    "this optical light and these x-rays.", 
    "Because look, this path length is longer to us", 
    "than this path length.", 
    "And therefore we were hoping not only to be able to see an", 
    "optical flash, which would mean the x-ray heating of the", 
    "disk the optical light on the disk.", 
    "But we were also hoping to see to delay.", 
    "If you can measure the delay--", 
    "if you see a one second delay--", 
    "it would mean that this geometry was roughly one light", 
    "second from here to here.", 
    "And so we were very ambitious.", 
    "We organized a worldwide campaign in", 
    "the summer of 1977.", 
    "With SAS 3 we were going to observe one particular x-ray", 
    "burst source in the sky for two weeks on.", 
    "And we were asking observers from the ground-- optical,", 
    "radio, infrared observers--", 
    "to keep an eye on that object and also observe that all the", 
    "time, as long as they could.", 
    "17 countries contributed.", 
    "44 observatories contributed, participated.", 
    "And during these two weeks, we saw 110 x-ray bursts from this", 
    "object with SAS 3.", 
    "None were observed in the optical.", 
    "None were observed in the radio.", 
    "In 1978 we tried it again, and we were successful.", 
    "This was a collaboration with Josh Grindlay, who was at the", 
    "time at Harvard, and my graduate student Jeff", 
    "McClintock--", 
    "who was at that time already Doctor McClintock--", 
    "he also was at Harvard and he still is there.", 
    "It was a smashing success.", 
    "We made it to the cover of Nature, which is a rather", 
    "prestigious scientific journal.", 
    "It was covered by The New York Times and by many newspapers", 
    "in the world.", 
    "So we were the first to be able to detect simultaneously", 
    "an x-ray burst and an optical burst from this binary system.", 
    "The data that I want to show you--", 
    "not the 1978 data, but the data from a year later because", 
    "they have better quality.", 
    "We learned how to do it, of course.", 
    "These are the x-ray data, not from SAS 3, because SAS 3 was", 
    "no longer in orbit in 1979.", 
    "This was a Japanese satellite Hakucho.", 
    "And so here you see the times in seconds.", 
    "And here you see the x-ray intensity.", 
    "And you see here the x-ray bursts as we observed it with", 
    "the Japanese observatory, Hakucho.", 
    "And here you see the optical data, which were taken by my", 
    "friend and colleague, Holger Pedersen.", 
    "He used the European Southern Observatory in Chile.", 
    "And he observed clearly an optical flash.", 
    "This is the intensity of the light before the x-ray bursts.", 
    "And then you see an incredible increase, and", 
    "then you see a decay.", 
    "I have plotted these so that they both", 
    "have the same height.", 
    "That of course is artificial but it makes it easier to", 
    "compare the two.", 
    "And so now comes the acid test.", 
    "If now I put one on top of another, then you see very", 
    "clearly that, as we expected all along, that the optical", 
    "signal is indeed delayed relative to the x-ray signal.", 
    "And you can now do the measurement that we", 
    "hoped we could do.", 
    "You shift one curve on top of another, and if you shift it", 
    "by about two seconds, then they're almost carbon copies", 
    "of each other.", 
    "So we succeeded then for the first time to measure the", 
    "geometry of the accretion disk around these neutron stars.", 
    "They have radii of very roughly two light seconds.", 
    "Light had to travel two seconds more--", 
    "first x-rays, x-ray heating, and then the optical.", 
    "Two light seconds is about twice the distance from the", 
    "Earth to the moon.", 
    "So these systems are amazingly compact, very small indeed.", 
    "Needless to say that during the last term, I haven't been", 
    "able to do any research.", 
    "No science at all.", 
    "8.02 has swallowed up everything that I had", 
    "to offer and more.", 
    "And I think you should feel sorry", 
    "for my graduate students.", 
    "And I think you have all the right to feel guilty as well.", 
    "You were on my mind all the time.", 
    "And not only at MIT, but also at home in my living room, my", 
    "kitchen, when I took showers, and you even, very often,", 
    "appeared in my dreams.", 
    "Believe me, it was hell for my significant other, who is in", 
    "the audience, Susan.", 
    "It wasn't very nice for her.", 
    "Frankly, my life will change after today.", 
    "I make myself no illusion however.", 
    "Most of you will quickly forget all", 
    "four Maxwell's equations.", 
    "And you will forget all about induction and about", 
    "nonconservative fields.", 
    "I hope for you, though, that it will not", 
    "be before next week.", 
    "But surely, when you will see a rainbow, you won't be able", 
    "to resist to check that the red is on the outside and the", 
    "blue is on the inside.", 
    "It is a disease for which there is no cure.", 
    "And if you carry your personal polarizers with you, then you", 
    "will want to verify that indeed the bows", 
    "are strongly polarized.", 
    "And if you do that, I'll be very proud of you.", 
    "And if that's all you will ever remember of 8.02--", 
    "long after you've forgotten all about Ampere and Gauss,", 
    "Faraday, and Maxwell, long after you don't even remember", 
    "how to spell their names.", 
    "If that's all of you ever remember, I will have achieved", 
    "something that has enriched your life.", 
    "And you will remember me.", 
    "And I hope those will be happy memories.", 
    "Thank you for attending my lectures."
