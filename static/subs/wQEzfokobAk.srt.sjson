    "WALTER LEWIN: You have 10 days left for your motor.", 
    "So that's a nice project for spring break.", 
    "I'll give you some hints.", 
    "Keep the friction of your rotor as low as you can.", 
    "You can't use any oil, of course, That's not allowed.", 
    "Balance your rotor to the best you can.", 
    "And try to avoid that the rotor begins to bounce, begins", 
    "to vibrate.", 
    "Because when it vibrates, it loses contact with the current", 
    "when it needs it.", 
    "So there's no torque.", 
    "How will we test your motors?", 
    "We do that with the stroboscope And I've decided", 
    "to demonstrate to you how we're going to do that.", 
    "That's probably the best thing to do.", 
    "We have a disk.", 
    "We're going to rotate the disk at 1,000 RPM.", 
    "Let's assume that is your motor.", 
    "And we're going to strobe it with a strobe light, until it", 
    "stands still.", 
    "In this case, I have set the strobe so that it will stand", 
    "still, roughly.", 
    "And the strobe is now going at 500 RPM, and the motor is", 
    "going at 1,000 RPM.", 
    "So this clearly is not the rotation rate of your motor.", 
    "In fact, your motor goes twice around between the blinks.", 
    "And we have no way of knowing that.", 
    "So we double the frequency.", 
    "I'm trying to double it now.", 
    "Double the frequency of the blinking of the strobe light.", 
    "And now it stands still again.", 
    "So now we may think your motor is going 1,000 RPM.", 
    "But we don't know yet.", 
    "Maybe it's going 2,000 RPM, maybe 3,000 RPM.", 
    "So what we're going to do now, we're going", 
    "to double the frequency.", 
    "And so we go now with the strobe light to 2,000 RPM.", 
    "And what we see now is we see a double image.", 
    "So 2000 RPM is out, and any multiple of 2000 RPM is out.", 
    "So 4,000 is out.", 
    "6,000, and 8,000 is out.", 
    "But what is not yet out is 3,000, and 5,000, and 7,000.", 
    "So we would have to test for that.", 
    "On the other hand, I told you already that this motor is", 
    "going 1,000 RPM.", 
    "So there's no sense in testing that now.", 
    "But during the actual contest, of course we will continue all", 
    "the way until we are convinced that we have the", 
    "right RPM for you motor.", 
    "And so that's the way we will do it.", 
    "We'll put a little bit of white paint on", 
    "one side of you rotor.", 
    "So that's the way it will be done.", 
    "Of course, if your motor is highly unstable in terms of", 
    "rotation rate, it will not be easy to get a correct number.", 
    "I want to talk with you about the heart.", 
    "Our heart has four chambers.", 
    "It looks sort of like this--", 
    "the left atrium, and right atrium.", 
    "Maybe this is why it's called the heart.", 
    "And here is the left and the right ventricle.", 
    "And here's the aorta.", 
    "The sole purpose of the heart is to pump blood, about five", 
    "quarts per minute, which is 75 gallons per hour, which is 70", 
    "barrels per day, which is about two million", 
    "barrels in 75 years.", 
    "And it pumps about 70 times per minute.", 
    "If the blood to your brain stops for about five seconds,", 
    "you lose consciousness.", 
    "So it's five skips of the heartbeat, and", 
    "you're down on the floor.", 
    "And four minutes later, permanent brain damage.", 
    "The way the heart works is absolutely mind boggling,", 
    "extremely complicated.", 
    "Nature had one billion years to design it.", 
    "But nevertheless, it's impressive.", 
    "Each heart cell is a mini chemical battery.", 
    "And it pumps ions in or out as it pleases.", 
    "In a normal state, each heart cell is -80 millivolts on the", 
    "inside, relative to the outside.", 
    "There are some cells which are called pacemaker cells.", 
    "They're located in a very small area about one square", 
    "millimeter near the right atrium.", 
    "And they change their potential from -80 millivolts", 
    "to +20 millivolts.", 
    "Why they do that is a different story, which I will", 
    "not address.", 
    "Once they go to +20 millivolts, the neighboring", 
    "cells follow.", 
    "And a wave propagates over the heart.", 
    "I'll make you a drawing shortly.", 
    "So the wave first moves over the atrial chambers, and then", 
    "over the ventricle chambers.", 
    "And when the cells are at +20 millivolts inside, relative to", 
    "the outside, they contract.", 
    "So they form a muscle.", 
    "The whole heart is one big muscle.", 
    "And after about 0.2 of a second, the cells return to", 
    "-80 millivolts.", 
    "And this wave goes from below to above.", 
    "And then the whole thing waits again for another message from", 
    "the pacemaker cells.", 
    "It takes about one second.", 
    "And then the whole process starts all over.", 
    "Now I want to be more precise.", 
    "Here is one heart cell.", 
    "So this is about 10 microns in size.", 
    "And this cell has 80 millivolts, with respect to", 
    "the outside.", 
    "So that means it has repelled positive ions, and so the", 
    "inside is negative.", 
    "And there's no E field here outside.", 
    "Because we put a Gaussian surface around here.", 
    "There's no net charge inside.", 
    "But there is of course a electric field across the", 
    "walls here, from plus to minus.", 
    "Now the depolarization, which is the change to the +20", 
    "millivolt state, starts.", 
    "And it starts from above.", 
    "And I will assume now that it is not +20, but 0 millivolts.", 
    "And it's easier to see.", 
    "If we have this cell, and the wave is halfway down, and this", 
    "is now 0 millivolts, then there is no longer minus", 
    "charge here, and no longer plus charge here.", 
    "Because 0 millivolt relative to the outside world.", 
    "So there's no electric field across here anymore.", 
    "In other words, what the cell has done, it has moved", 
    "positive ions back in.", 
    "But here, the situation is still as it was before.", 
    "So this is still at your -80 millivolts.", 
    "And if you look now, you have here a minus layer on top of a", 
    "positive layer--", 
    "positive here, minus on top.", 
    "And that creates an electric field, which has roughly the", 
    "shape of a electric dipole.", 
    "It has this shape.", 
    "So as the wave goes through the cells, only then do they", 
    "create a dipole.", 
    "And we call this the depolarization.", 
    "A little later in time, when this wave has passed, the", 
    "whole thing is +20 millivolts.", 
    "I chose zero here, but it really goes to +20.", 
    "This is just easier to explain.", 
    "So that means that now the inside is plus.", 
    "Positive ions are now inside.", 
    "Negative ions are outside.", 
    "And the E field here is, again, zero.", 
    "Now there is the repolarization wave, which", 
    "comes from below, when it goes back to -80 millivolts.", 
    "And I will again do the same trick that I did before.", 
    "I will just assume the wave is half way, that it is not -80,", 
    "but that it is 0 millivolts.", 
    "So there are no charges here, but the", 
    "charges here are unchanged.", 
    "So what do you have now here?", 
    "You have a minus layer on top of a plus later.", 
    "So you have exactly what you had before.", 
    "So again you get an electric field within the electric", 
    "dipole fields, which has again the same shape.", 
    "So what's going to happen is the depolarization wave is", 
    "going to run down, leaves behind here the cells at +20", 
    "millivolts when they are contracted.", 
    "So this part of the heart has already pumped,", 
    "and it moves down.", 
    "And only the cells where the depolarization occurs--", 
    "that's only the ones on the ring--", 
    "contribute to that electric dipole field.", 
    "If there's no wave, which is a sizable fraction of the heart,", 
    "of the cycle, there's no wave, then there's no electric", 
    "dipole field.", 
    "And when the repolarization goes in the other direction,", 
    "when the heart relaxes because the cells go back to -80", 
    "millivolts, then again there is an electric dipole field,", 
    "but only from the cells through which the", 
    "repolarization wave moves.", 
    "And you could very easily see that the electric dipole", 
    "fields of all these cells here support each other.", 
    "So you get a dipole field from the heart.", 
    "And so if I make you look at your heart--", 
    "so this is you.", 
    "This is your body, your legs.", 
    "This is your arms.", 
    "And here's your heart.", 
    "And there goes this wave.", 
    "And so here is your electric field that is generated while", 
    "the wave is going, either depolarization down or", 
    "repolarization up.", 
    "But if there is an electric field, there's going to be", 
    "potential difference between different parts of your body.", 
    "You look at your belly button, and you follow this electric", 
    "field line at your head, there's an E field.", 
    "The integral E dot dl gives you a potential difference.", 
    "And so now you see that there are going to be potential", 
    "differences between the various parts of your body.", 
    "And that's the idea behind an electrocardiogram.", 
    "Typically there are 12 electrodes attached to arms,", 
    "legs, head, and chest to get as much information about the", 
    "heart as we can.", 
    "And the maximum potential difference between two", 
    "electrodes, in general, is not more than about 2 to 3", 
    "millivolts.", 
    "I'd like to show you a healthy heart cardiogram", 
    "of a healthy person.", 
    "I have that here.", 
    "Time here is about one second.", 
    "And from here to here is about 1 millivolt.", 
    "The P wave--", 
    "we call this the P wave--", 
    "that is observed when the atrium is being depolarized,", 
    "so when the depolarization wave goes over the atrium.", 
    "A little later it goes over the ventricle, and you get a", 
    "larger potential difference, because there's more muscle in", 
    "the ventricle.", 
    "So that's why this R wave is higher.", 
    "The T wave is the repolarization, when the wave", 
    "goes back over the ventricles.", 
    "The dipole field is in the same direction, remember.", 
    "That's the T wave.", 
    "It's not known-- at least it wasn't known until recently--", 
    "what causes the U wave.", 
    "I talked to a heart expert about this,", 
    "Professor Cohen at MIT.", 
    "And I was surprised to learn that it's not known what the U", 
    "wave is about.", 
    "Not everyone's cardiogram looks as healthy as this one.", 
    "There is a terrible disease, which 400,000 people die of", 
    "per year in the United States, which is known as ventricular", 
    "fibrillation, also known as sudden death.", 
    "The ventricles fire without any message from the pacemaker", 
    "wave, and there's random nonsynchronous depolarization.", 
    "So the heart doesn't pump any more.", 
    "In five seconds you lose consciousness, on the floor.", 
    "And in four minutes, you have permanent brain damage.", 
    "In hospitals, heart patients are being monitored.", 
    "And as soon as it's noticed that there's something wrong", 
    "like this, so severe as the ventricular fibrillation, then", 
    "they apply electric shock treatments.", 
    "You have to be fast.", 
    "You only have a few minutes before you get brain damage.", 
    "And 3,000 volts is applied.", 
    "One amperes for about a tenth of a second.", 
    "Large plates are being used on each side of the chest.", 
    "And this, of course, is enough to kill the patient.", 
    "But it makes little difference, because the", 
    "patients would have died anyhow.", 
    "Heart patients can also get synchronization problems, and", 
    "then they implant a pacemaker.", 
    "It's a circuit.", 
    "And this pacemaker takes over the role from", 
    "the pacemaker cells.", 
    "When the heart beat rate falls below a certain rate, the", 
    "artificial pacemaker takes over, about 10 milliamperes", 
    "for half a millisecond, and it does it 60 times a minute.", 
    "And so it triggers then the depolarization wave.", 
    "These pacemakers are susceptible to influences from", 
    "the outside world.", 
    "And one person's pacemaker stopped, for instance, every", 
    "10 seconds due to a radar sweep from a police car.", 
    "It's also possible that you get a built in defibrillator.", 
    "In other words, a system that gives you electric shocks when", 
    "sudden death might otherwise occur.", 
    "So it senses that something is wrong, that the ventricle is", 
    "going to fibrillation.", 
    "And then it applies, all by itself, 650 volts, about 5.5", 
    "milliseconds, up to 5 to 10 amperes.", 
    "And that's not enough to kill the patient.", 
    "And the whole idea is a wake up call to the heart, to get", 
    "it back into synchronization, to get this depolarization", 
    "wave being synchronized again.", 
    "So clearly I would like to show now a heart", 
    "cardiogram of a student.", 
    "And I prefer to have a healthy one to avoid some", 
    "difficulties.", 
    "You feel strong?", 
    "You're a healthy person?", 
    "You don't mind volunteering?", 
    "Tight pants.", 
    "So we have to do something about it.", 
    "OK, why don't you sit down?", 
    "Well there's nothing I-- come in.", 
    "We'll find a way.", 
    "So we have to attach.", 
    "We don't have 12 electrodes.", 
    "We only use three.", 
    "And the first one--", 
    "that's why I was worried about your tight pants.", 
    "Can you roll them up a little?", 
    "OK, now this one goes here.", 
    "Let's hope that it makes good contact.", 
    "Now the others go on your arm.", 
    "And we need very good electrical contact.", 
    "And therefore we put some conducting grease on there.", 
    "We'll make it a bit of a mess, but we'll give you a chance", 
    "later to clean up.", 
    "So let's first put this one--", 
    "you're relaxed right?", 
    "Yes, of course.", 
    "So can you roll up your sleeve, there?", 
    "Very good.", 
    "And maybe you can put this over your arm?", 
    "That's good.", 
    "Higher.", 
    "Oh man, boy, you have muscles.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Just relax.", 
    "If it hurts a little, oh well, that's the way it is.", 
    "We need good contact.", 
    "OK, now your other arm.", 
    "Again, a little bit of gooky stuff.", 
    "You need another rubber band, so put around", 
    "your arm, high up.", 
    "That's good.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So now it's very important that you relax.", 
    "Because when you start moving, the other muscle cells will", 
    "also produce electric dipole fields.", 
    "And that's we don't want, because then that will be", 
    "overpowering.", 
    "I'm going to make you take a look at this.", 
    "Yeah, everything OK?", 
    "So I'm going to change the light situation so that you", 
    "can see shortly there what's coming up.", 
    "Oh man, look at this.", 
    "I don't see your P wave.", 
    "But you have an amazing R wave.", 
    "It looks like your R wave is in the wrong direction.", 
    "You feel OK, though right?", 
    "Yeah, I can't see your P wave.", 
    "Well maybe some people survive without P waves.", 
    "It's certainly an unusual heart.", 
    "But if you tell me that you are healthy, then I'll take", 
    "your word for that.", 
    "I think it would be nice if you show class now-- why don't", 
    "you just stand up for a while-- that your other", 
    "muscles begin to act.", 
    "And they will see then-- just stand up, move a little bit", 
    "your arms--", 
    "you see, now you get the electric dipole fields from", 
    "the other muscles in the body, which contract.", 
    "This is even more interesting than your heart, man.", 
    "Sit down again, and let's take it off.", 
    "And then you can clean up.", 
    "Looks good.", 
    "Heart cardiograms are not so easy to interpret.", 
    "But I think you're looking fine.", 
    "And you feel all right, right?", 
    "That's important.", 
    "Thank you very much for volunteering, very courageous.", 
    "Make sure you clean that stuff off.", 
    "It's water soluble.", 
    "So it's not so bad.", 
    "What's your name, by the way?", 
    "Danny, you were great, Danny.", 
    "And now I want to talk about aurora borealis.", 
    "If we have a magnetic field, and we have a charged", 
    "particle, make it plus, and the velocity of that charged", 
    "particle is in this direction, then the force on that charged", 
    "particle-- the Lorentz force--", 
    "equals q times v cross B. I'm going to decompose this", 
    "velocity now into one component parallel to the", 
    "magnetic field, and into a component perpendicular to the", 
    "magnetic field.", 
    "So the vectorial sum of these two is v.", 
    "So I can rewrite this as q times v parallel plus v", 
    "perpendicular crossed with B. But v parallel crossed with B", 
    "is zero, because the angle is either 0 degrees or 180", 
    "degrees, so the sine of the angle is zero.", 
    "And so the force is exclusively", 
    "determined by this term.", 
    "It's by the perpendicular component.", 
    "And so what's going to happen, this charged particle is going", 
    "to circle around.", 
    "But then it continues to go in this direction with that", 
    "velocity v parallel.", 
    "And so you're going to see a path like this.", 
    "Whereby this radius R of that circle, that radius--", 
    "I still remember it from the lecture when we discussed", 
    "that-- that was m v divided by q B. But the v now is the", 
    "perpendicular component divided by q B. And then in", 
    "this direction, it continues unaltered with the velocity,", 
    "which is the parallel component."
