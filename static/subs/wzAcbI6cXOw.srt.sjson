    "WALTER LEWIN: Optical light is 2 electron volts where x-rays,", 
    "way more energetic than optical light.", 
    "During the Second World War, Wernher von Braun, in", 
    "Peenemunde, developed under Hitler", 
    "Germany, destructive rockets.", 
    "They were used to destroy the allies, to destroy you and me.", 
    "Then after the war, around 1948, the Americans used these", 
    "rockets to do science.", 
    "They also got Wernher von Braun over to this country.", 
    "And for reasons unknown to me, he became a hero.", 
    "They tried to observe x-rays from the solar system, and", 
    "they found, indeed, that the sun emits x-rays.", 
    "The sun is very close, so you may say, well,", 
    "that's not a surprise.", 
    "But it's really very unusual because to create x-rays, you", 
    "need extremely high temperatures, which we didn't", 
    "think existed on the sun.", 
    "And if you take the power that the sun puts out in x-rays--", 
    "this is joules per second now--", 
    "and you divide that by the power in the optical and the", 
    "infrared light of the sun, this symbol stands for sun.", 
    "That ratio is about 10 to the -7.", 
    "So you must conclude that the sun emits largely optical", 
    "light and infrared, and that the amount of x-rays is a", 
    "modest byproduct.", 
    "Interesting, as it is, all by itself.", 
    "In 1962, several scientists here in Cambridge,", 
    "Massachusetts, among them Bruno Rossi and Riccardo", 
    "Giacconi and Herb Gursky, made an attempt to observe x-rays", 
    "from stars outside our solar system.", 
    "The odds were strongly against them.", 
    "The detectors were not sensitive enough.", 
    "If you take the sun and you bring the sun to the nearest", 
    "stars, which is a distance, say, of 10 light years, then", 
    "there would be no hope that you would be able to detect", 
    "x-rays from an object like the sun.", 
    "In fact, the detectors were too insensitive by about a", 
    "factor of 1 billion.", 
    "They tried anyhow, and they were successful.", 
    "They did, indeed, find to everyone's surprise and joy,", 
    "they found x-rays from at least one object outside the", 
    "solar system.", 
    "This object was later called Sco X-1.", 
    "Sco stands for the consolation Scorpio in the sky, and X for", 
    "x-rays, and 1 as the first source observed in that", 
    "constellation.", 
    "We now know that this object is a faint blue star.", 
    "And what is extremely special about the object Sco X-1 is", 
    "that if you take the ratio x-ray power of optical power,", 
    "then that ratio is about 10 to the 3.", 
    "Compare that with the sun.", 
    "This object, we had no clue what it was in those days.", 
    "Primarily emit x-rays.", 
    "And the optical emission is a byproduct.", 
    "Whereas with the sun, it is reversed.", 
    "And so the burning question was, in those days, what kind", 
    "of animal is this?", 
    "It must be a totally different beast.", 
    "Something very different from our sun.", 
    "And when I came to MIT in 1966, there were a few dozen", 
    "sources known outside our solar system.", 
    "And they were all discovered with rockets.", 
    "The rockets, in those days, could spend about five minutes", 
    "above the Earth's atmosphere, and they would quickly make a", 
    "scan over the sky.", 
    "Five minutes, that's all they had.", 
    "And I joined the group of George Clark,", 
    "who is still at MIT.", 
    "He was doing x-ray astronomy from very high-flying", 
    "balloons, very close to the top of the atmosphere.", 
    "And the advantage of balloons was that you could observe the", 
    "sky for many, many hours.", 
    "If you're lucky, sometimes even a day or more.", 
    "But on the other hand, since there's always a little bit of", 
    "atmosphere left above you, even though there's very", 
    "little, there is still some left, the x-rays are absorbed.", 
    "Almost all x-rays below 20 kilo electron volts would be", 
    "absorbed, and we would not be able to see them.", 
    "But of course, the compensation was that we could", 
    "look at the sky for many, many, many hours.", 
    "Nowadays, no one is doing these balloon", 
    "observations anymore.", 
    "No more rocket observations.", 
    "Everything is done, of course, from satellites.", 
    "So when I came to MIT together with George Clark, I developed", 
    "new x-ray detectors for these balloon observations.", 
    "Many graduate students were involved, many undergraduates.", 
    "It would take about two years to build a telescope.", 
    "To give you a rough idea, it would take a million dollars", 
    "in terms of 1966 dollars.", 
    "And the weight of such a telescope would be roughly", 
    "1,000 kilograms.", 
    "The balloons in those days would cost about $100,000 to", 
    "get us up to these high altitudes.", 
    "And we would need about $80,000 of helium.", 
    "You will see some slides of that.", 
    "We have to go to altitudes of about 140,000 feet.", 
    "We need huge balloons for that.", 
    "You will see one.", 
    "They have diameters of about 600 feet.", 
    "And the material was polyethylene--", 
    "extremely thin to make them lightweight, so", 
    "that they can go high.", 
    "Your thickness of that polyethylene was about half of", 
    ".001 of an inch, which is thinner than the Saran wrap", 
    "that you have in the kitchen.", 
    "It is thinner than cigarette paper.", 
    "A very risky business to fly these balloons.", 
    "No guarantee, of course, that they would work.", 
    "You pay your money.", 
    "If they work, that's great.", 
    "If they don't work, that's just tough luck.", 
    "There's a good chance that you have a failure when you launch", 
    "the balloon.", 
    "They're very fragile.", 
    "There could be damage right at the launch.", 
    "But even if they make it up in the atmosphere, they have to", 
    "go through the tropopause near around 100,000 feet, where", 
    "it's very, very cold.", 
    "The balloons get brittle.", 
    "And then, they can burst.", 
    "And that of course, would be the end then, of", 
    "that balloon flight.", 
    "And that could also be the end of a PhD thesis.", 
    "Because all these flights, of course, were", 
    "connected with research.", 
    "And therefore, with PhD work.", 
    "And so the tension during these early phases of the", 
    "launch were always extremely high.", 
    "Sometimes even unbearable.", 
    "So now I would like to show you some slides, which will", 
    "give you a good idea of what these expeditions were like.", 
    "Oh yeah, the classic problem.", 
    "This is nice that these-- oh, now they work.", 
    "All right, so if I can have the first slide.", 
    "You see here Jim and Pat, who at the time were", 
    "undergraduates.", 
    "They are now both PhDs.", 
    "And they are working there.", 
    "Very tedious work, trying to put the electronics together.", 
    "You may think that science is not very romantic, but I can", 
    "assure you it is.", 
    "They fell in love.", 
    "They married.", 
    "They have kids.", 
    "And that's the way it sometimes goes in life.", 
    "So here you see the plant in Texas where these huge", 
    "balloons were made.", 
    "The balloons are put together sort of like the way that the", 
    "tangerine is put together.", 
    "At the surface, you see these gores of the balloon.", 
    "And the ceiling of these gores to make up the balloon was", 
    "only done by women.", 
    "Only women were allowed to work there.", 
    "It's nothing to do with sex discrimination of any kind, it", 
    "just turned out that women were more patient.", 
    "They did the work better.", 
    "They make way fewer mistakes than men did.", 
    "That's the way it goes sometimes in life.", 
    "Here you see balloon coming out of the box, nicely", 
    "protected in a plastic cover.", 
    "And we also have here cloth on the grass because the balloon", 
    "is so thin that it would certainly get damaged if it", 
    "touches the grass.", 
    "It's enormously thin.", 
    "This was not my balloon.", 
    "We were worried that there was something wrong with it.", 
    "You can see here the concern.", 
    "They thought there was a hole in the balloon.", 
    "And if there's a hole in the balloon, there's just nothing", 
    "you can do about it anymore.", 
    "You can't patch it because the hole is almost always through", 
    "many, many layers.", 
    "What you're looking at here is hundreds of layers of balloon", 
    "that are folded together.", 
    "But as I said, since it wasn't my balloon,", 
    "I wasn't too worried.", 
    "But of course, it's never nice if you see a failure of your", 
    "colleagues.", 
    "So now I bring you to the dessert town Alice Springs in", 
    "Australia, right at the heart of Australia.", 
    "And now you get a pretty good idea of what it's like.", 
    "Here you see the launch truck.", 
    "The telescope is there.", 
    "And then you see this enormously big balloon.", 
    "All of it is empty now, and most of this will stay empty.", 
    "This is the roller arm, which holds this part down.", 
    "This is the only part that will be inflated.", 
    "And here you see the helium truck.", 
    "And here you see the inflation tubes.", 
    "And we will let helium in from both sides, which will then", 
    "gradually begin to fill this top part of the balloon.", 
    "And you see here the roller arm in detail.", 
    "The roller arm is very important.", 
    "Because when this part of the balloon is being filled, it", 
    "wants to lift.", 
    "It wants to go up.", 
    "And of course, you have to keep it down.", 
    "You have to keep it under control.", 
    "And so this roller arm in this car is", 
    "loaded down with concrete.", 
    "It's very heavy.", 
    "And then, just before the launch, this roller arm, by", 
    "command, is flipped over.", 
    "And then, as you will see later, then the balloon will", 
    "make it up.", 
    "And here you see the early part of the inflation.", 
    "Helium comes in from both sides.", 
    "And so we fly these balloons almost always early morning", 
    "because then the winds are very calm.", 
    "You need extremely reliable winds.", 
    "You need to know the direction very well.", 
    "And the winds should be no more than something like three", 
    "or four miles per hour.", 
    "If they are stronger, you would lose the balloon.", 
    "You see here these gores that I mentioned to you earlier.", 
    "The sun is behind the balloon.", 
    "Now here the bubble is nearly fully inflated now.", 
    "Here, still going on.", 
    "Still going on, the inflation, but we are very close.", 
    "Toward the end of the inflation here", 
    "is the roller arm.", 
    "And then, in this direction here, 500 feet or so down, is", 
    "the payload with the truck.", 
    "We're now very close to a launch.", 
    "We're still in Alice Springs.", 
    "This was my graduate student Jeff McClintock at the time.", 
    "He's now Dr. McClintock.", 
    "You will see radar reflectors, which allows us to follow the", 
    "balloon radar.", 
    "Here we see the telescope hanging on the launch truck.", 
    "Here is the roller arm.", 
    "All of this is empty.", 
    "And here you see the parachute.", 
    "We have here a connection between the parachute and the", 
    "bottom of the balloon.", 
    "And we can control that on radio command.", 
    "We can separate that, so that the telescope safely comes", 
    "back to Earth.", 
    "At least that's the idea on paper.", 
    "And so now you see the release of the bubble.", 
    "So the roller arm is up.", 
    "And this bubble now takes off.", 
    "This is an incredibly fantastic moment.", 
    "This is really butterflies in your stomach and", 
    "ants in your pants.", 
    "This is the moment that balloon can easily fail.", 
    "It's very thin material.", 
    "The helium goes up, reflects against the top, it's pushed", 
    "back again.", 
    "You get this peculiar mushroom shape.", 
    "It makes an enormous sound, like a storm.", 
    "The idea now is that this balloon will go higher and", 
    "higher in the sky.", 
    "It will pick up all this empty part.", 
    "This is not inflated.", 
    "As the balloon goes up in the atmosphere, the atmospheric", 
    "pressure will go down.", 
    "And the helium will expand and will fill the balloon.", 
    "And the trick now is for this truck to manipulate, to", 
    "maneuver itself under what we call the bubble.", 
    "And therefore, the wind has to be in this direction, so that", 
    "the balloon comes to the truck.", 
    "And then, the truck tries to get", 
    "straight under the balloon.", 
    "And then, the payload will be released here.", 
    "Here you see a close-up of this mushroom.", 
    "You can actually see this reflection of the helium going", 
    "up and coming back.", 
    "You can also see these gores very clearly.", 
    "It's tedious work by these women who have", 
    "to seal these balloons.", 
    "Enormous amount of labor goes into it.", 
    "Amount of helium, as I said earlier, is about $80,000,", 
    "about the same price of the balloon.", 
    "And here it goes higher.", 
    "In Alice Springs, the cover is falling off.", 
    "Balloon is going up.", 
    "The engine is already running.", 
    "The truck cannot move yet, because if it started to move,", 
    "this part of the balloon would slide over the cloth.", 
    "There would be friction and there would be", 
    "holes in the balloon.", 
    "So this truck has to wait until all of", 
    "this is off the ground.", 
    "Going higher.", 
    "And I am now so close to the balloon that I couldn't", 
    "continue my picture taking from Alice Springs, so I will", 
    "jump back to an earlier flight in the United States.", 
    "We flew these balloons in the United States from a town", 
    "called Palestine, Texas.", 
    "And so you will see then the remaining part of the flight", 
    "from Palestine, Texas.", 
    "So the balloon is now completely off the ground.", 
    "See a little bit of gas.", 
    "Well, it's not so little, but looks very little compared to", 
    "the size of this balloon.", 
    "You see the parachute here.", 
    "And here then is the connection, which on radio", 
    "command, we can separate.", 
    "So now this is a very crucial moment.", 
    "The person in charge on this launch truck has probably", 
    "driven the truck to get straight under the balloon.", 
    "And when it's straight under there, they will allow the", 
    "payload to go free.", 
    "The payload is attached to this truck.", 
    "If the balloon is too far ahead and the payload is", 
    "released, it will pendulum into the ground.", 
    "And if you release it too early, then of course, the", 
    "payload will pendulum back into the launch truck.", 
    "Both would be a disaster.", 
    "If the pull of the balloon is not enough.", 
    "For instance, if a hole developed during the launch,", 
    "so if the tension is not strong enough, you would", 
    "release the payload.", 
    "It would go bang back to the ground.", 
    "So all these factors have to be taken into account.", 
    "And then finally, the person in charge commits to a launch.", 
    "And then, there it goes.", 
    "All the way empty.", 
    "Here you see the helium, the parachute,", 
    "and you see the payload.", 
    "And here you see the balloon at 150,000 feet, 45 kilometers", 
    "high in the sky.", 
    "The helium has now expanded.", 
    "Balloon is fully inflated.", 
    "Now you can look straight through it.", 
    "It's only half of 1/1,000 of an inch of polyethylene.", 
    "And these are huge ducts, which have openings of about", 
    "10 meters each.", 
    "They are there because the balloon cannot stand any", 
    "overpressure.", 
    "If there's any overpressure, the balloon would pop.", 
    "And so when the balloon keeps rising and rising and rising,", 
    "when it reaches its maximum volume, the helium would", 
    "escape at the bottom.", 
    "That's the idea of these ducts.", 
    "Here you see George Ricker, who was graduate student, my", 
    "graduate student at the time.", 
    "This is in Australia.", 
    "He is now Dr. Ricker.", 
    "He's still at MIT.", 
    "He's a staff member.", 
    "And this is the kind of equipment that we built, at", 
    "least partially.", 
    "And he's checking the early results during the ascent of", 
    "the balloon.", 
    "The balloon will go up with about 1,000 feet a minute if", 
    "all goes well.", 
    "If there's no leak, it will take about two and a half", 
    "three hours to make it to altitude.", 
    "You see me here sitting on the plane that we used to follow", 
    "the balloon.", 
    "We fly, of course, at much lower altitudes--", 
    "5,000, 1,000 feet.", 
    "We stay as close to the balloon as we possibly can.", 
    "It's not always easy, certainly not in Australia.", 
    "And so we keep an eye on things.", 
    "And if necessary, we can terminate the balloon flight", 
    "by giving a radio command so that the parachute comes down.", 
    "Certainly when we get close to the ocean, of course, that is", 
    "necessary if you don't want to lose the payload.", 
    "The data come back via radio, so we wouldn't lose the data.", 
    "You get very sick, by the way, in these planes.", 
    "If you're sitting for 8 or 10 or 12 hours or longer in these", 
    "planes, as I have.", 
    "I learned actually, a little bit of flying, which is quite", 
    "easy with a plane like this.", 
    "Here you see a map of Australia.", 
    "Here's Alice Springs.", 
    "We fly pro balloons, weather balloons at 140,000 feet every", 
    "day, to find out in what direction the", 
    "balloon would be drifting.", 
    "And we had all reasons to believe that the balloon would", 
    "drift somewhere in this direction.", 
    "And we alerted these radar stations.", 
    "These circles here are radar stations, because there are no", 
    "airfields here in Australia.", 
    "And so we knew we couldn't follow the balloon.", 
    "We would probably lose it.", 
    "And therefore, we alerted these radar stations they", 
    "could tell us then when the balloon was in sight, and that", 
    "would allow us then to cut the balloon, cut the payload", 
    "loose, and make the recovery.", 
    "Instead, the balloon went straight south.", 
    "So the predictions by the weather balloons", 
    "were not too accurate.", 
    "Balloon went straight south.", 
    "And here, there was sunset.", 
    "And then we don't know too precisely", 
    "where the balloon was.", 
    "Remember, this was in the 1970s.", 
    "And so we were uncertain.", 
    "But here, about 26 hours later, when we were getting", 
    "close to Melbourne, which we were not allowed to enter the", 
    "airspace here between Sydney and Melbourne, we got the", 
    "balloon lose.", 
    "That means we separate the payload from the balloon.", 
    "The balloon is very brittle.", 
    "It's extremely cold up there.", 
    "The balloon then fractures and comes down in many pieces.", 
    "And if everything works well, then the parachute opens and", 
    "brings the payload safely back to Earth.", 
    "And then comes the big problem, how are you going to", 
    "recover the payload?", 
    "You're in the middle of nowhere.", 
    "This balloon came down, this payload", 
    "came down in the desert.", 
    "And there are no airports.", 
    "At least the chances are that you are a few hundred miles", 
    "away from the nearest airport with your payload.", 
    "So what you do then is the following.", 
    "You try to find a house close to where", 
    "the payload is located.", 
    "We locate the payload.", 
    "We see the stuff come down.", 
    "Radio beacons on the payload.", 
    "And then you fly over that house many, many times in a", 
    "very obnoxious way.", 
    "You make a lot of noise.", 
    "You fly over very low.", 
    "And so the people who's next neighbor is probably 70 miles", 
    "away from them, know what you're trying to tell them.", 
    "You're trying to draw their attention.", 
    "And they know what that means is that they want you to meet", 
    "them at the airport, whatever airport means.", 
    "It's just a strip in the desert.", 
    "You can't land there at night, but you can land", 
    "there during the day.", 
    "And so that's exactly what we did.", 
    "We drew attention to the house of this guy, Jack.", 
    "He was a complete nut.", 
    "He was always drunk.", 
    "He was a crazy guy.", 
    "And so we went to the air strip and we waited.", 
    "And indeed, after 15 hours, he showed up with this truck.", 
    "There is no windshield here in the truck.", 
    "And he used to shoot kangaroos there.", 
    "He would go 60 miles per hour on the desert floor, and he", 
    "would shoot kangaroos.", 
    "And he gave me a demonstration.", 
    "He put his dog on the roof.", 
    "He would go 60 miles an hour, and he", 
    "would slammed the brakes.", 
    "And then the dog wood catapult through the air--", 
    "the poor dog.", 
    "And then all he would say is, oh, you can't teach an old dog", 
    "any new tricks.", 
    "And he seemed to enjoy that.", 
    "When we go after the payload, the plane, the recovery plane", 
    "is in the air, takes off from that air strip, and we have", 
    "contact with the recovery plane.", 
    "They and only they can see and know where the payload is.", 
    "From the ground, of course, you can't tell.", 
    "And so they maneuver you to the payload.", 
    "And so, of course, Jack's help was invaluable.", 
    "We needed him.", 
    "It was independent in the fact that the man", 
    "was a little strange.", 
    "On these recoveries, you encounter many animals.", 
    "You see a koala bear here in a eucalyptus tree.", 
    "Very lazy animal, unlike most of you.", 
    "And then when we came close to the payload, there was this", 
    "animal-- iguana.", 
    "Six feet tall iguana.", 
    "I'll tell you, it scared the hell out of me.", 
    "And I didn't want to show that to my graduate student", 
    "who was with me.", 
    "And I said to him, look, these animals", 
    "are completely harmless.", 
    "Why don't you go first?", 
    "This animal was no farther than four", 
    "feet from the payload.", 
    "And so my graduate student went first.", 
    "And the amazing thing is during the 10 hours that it", 
    "took us to recover the payload and put it back on Jack truck,", 
    "this animal never moved.", 
    "It was just sitting there completely still.", 
    "This is their way of trying not to be noticed.", 
    "And so here you see the payload.", 
    "This was--", 
    "Alice was Jack's wife.", 
    "This is Tom [? Brooks ?] who came from the United States.", 
    "He was an electronic expert.", 
    "And you see here the payload.", 
    "It looks heavily damaged, but it really isn't.", 
    "This is crash pad, which protects the", 
    "payload when it impacts.", 
    "And the impact crash pad worked very well.", 
    "There was very little damage of this payload.", 
    "And then you come back after several days to Alice Springs.", 
    "Alice Springs is a hole in the ground, nothing", 
    "ever happens there.", 
    "And so obviously you make it to the front page of the", 
    "Centralian Advocate.", 
    "\"Perfect Balloon Launch, Thousands Watch Start of Space", 
    "Probe.\" They think of this as a space probe, which is fine.", 
    "\"Balloon professor is back in Alice.\" They called me there", 
    "the balloon professor.", 
    "I gave several talks there for high schools and for the", 
    "rotary club.", 
    "I was sort of a local celebrity.", 
    "I talked to the news reporter for several hours.", 
    "And when you read his story, you", 
    "won't believe the nonsense.", 
    "But that's all the detail of course.", 
    "OK, that's enough for the slides for now.", 
    "I had about 20 successful flights between 1966 and 1980.", 
    "Many from the United States, from Canada, and also from", 
    "Australia where it's the Southern Hemisphere, which", 
    "covers part of the sky that we cannot see", 
    "from the United States.", 
    "I had two free falls.", 
    "Two of my balloon bursts on the way up in the tropopause.", 
    "We were unable to separate the payload fast enough.", 
    "And then, the whole thing--", 
    "parachute gets entangled.", 
    "You get a free fall, big hole in the ground, and that's the", 
    "end of the telescope.", 
    "And it was.", 
    "Twice did I lose the telescope completely.", 
    "But I was lucky and I made several interesting", 
    "discoveries during those successful flights.", 
    "We discovered very early on five new x-ray sources, none", 
    "of them had never been seen with the rockets.", 
    "And several of these sources--", 
    "that was the really new thing-- were highly variable.", 
    "They changed their x-ray intensity on a", 
    "very short time scale.", 
    "We noticed even one source went up by a factor of 3 in", 
    "about 10 minutes.", 
    "And that, of course, could not have been discovered with", 
    "rockets, because the rockets were only above the atmosphere", 
    "for five minutes.", 
    "They would quickly scan the sky.", 
    "And so there was no way they could discover variability on", 
    "a time scale of tens of minutes.", 
    "But with balloons, you can do that.", 
    "So it did pay off that we were watching the sky, sometimes", 
    "for 10, 20 hours.", 
    "My longest balloon flight was actually 26 hours.", 
    "We also observed x-rays from one source,", 
    "which we named GX1+4.", 
    "The 1+4 stands for the position in the sky.", 
    "And this showed a periodic signal in x-rays for about 2.3", 
    "minutes periodicity.", 
    "At the time, we had no clue what that meant.", 
    "But later, of course, we understood the", 
    "significance of that.", 
    "And you will understand that also very shortly how", 
    "significant that was.", 
    "So what kind of objects are they?", 
    "They are very, very different from the sun.", 
    "And we now know what they are.", 
    "These objects are binaries, binary stars.", 
    "One star is not unlike the sun.", 
    "It's a normal nuclear-burning star.", 
    "And it is in orbit with a neutron star.", 
    "Or in some cases, a black hole.", 
    "They go around each other.", 
    "And if they are close enough together, it is possible that", 
    "the matter of this star is attracted by this neutron star", 
    "with a larger force than it is attracted by the star itself.", 
    "And if that's the case, this matter doesn't", 
    "want to stay here.", 
    "It wants to go to the neutron star.", 
    "Now, of course, the matter has angular momentum because it", 
    "goes around.", 
    "So it cannot free fall to the neutron star, but it would", 
    "spiral in and slowly make its way to the neutron star.", 
    "And we call this an accretion disk.", 
    "And we call this the donor.", 
    "It provides the fuel for the transfer of mass onto the", 
    "neutron star.", 
    "And let's assume that the neutron star has a mass", 
    "capital M and has a radius r."
