    "WALTER LEWIN: And now I have to somehow manipulate, massage", 
    "the mathematics so that I get in here this magnetic moment,", 
    "this Bohr magneton, the two Bohr magnetons.", 
    "And there are several ways of doing that.", 
    "I have chosen one way, and that's the following.", 
    "I take here a length of 1 meter.", 
    "So this is a solenoid, and I pick only 1 meter.", 
    "Could have taken 3 or 5 meters, makes no difference.", 
    "I take 1 meter.", 
    "And each one of these loops here has an area A. So we", 
    "would agree, I hope, that the volume of this solenoid, which", 
    "has a length 1 meter, that that volume is A square", 
    "meters times 1.", 
    "And so the volume is A cubic meters.", 
    "A times 1 meter is A cubic meters.", 
    "But the number of atoms per cubic meter is 10 to the 29.", 
    "And so the number of atoms that I have in this solenoid", 
    "per meter is this A times that N. So this is the number of", 
    "windings, if I call this one winding, the number of", 
    "windings per meter.", 
    "Or you can think of it in number of atoms per meter, the", 
    "way they're lined up.", 
    "And so now I am in business.", 
    "Because this now is my N divided by l.", 
    "And so I can write now mu 0 times the current I times that", 
    "area A times N, which is 10 to the 29.", 
    "But look now.", 
    "Now you see why I did it this way.", 
    "Because I times A is the magnetic dipole", 
    "moment of my atoms.", 
    "And that was two Bohr magnetons.", 
    "And so this now also equals mu 0 times twice mu Bohr times N.", 
    "And I'm finished, because I know what mu 0 is.", 
    "And I know what mu Bohr is.", 
    "We calculated that.", 
    "It's still here, this number.", 
    "And I know what my capital subscript N is, 10 to the 29", 
    "atoms per cubic meter.", 
    "And so I just shove those numbers in my equation.", 
    "And I find that this is approximately 2.3 Tesla for", 
    "the numbers that I have chosen.", 
    "It's not for all materials this way.", 
    "Because I have adopted two Bohr magnetons for the", 
    "magnetic dipole moment of each atom.", 
    "And I have adopted a density of 10 to the 29 atoms per", 
    "cubic meter.", 
    "And for that situation, you get 2.3 Tesla.", 
    "Now I want to use this number and understand what's going to", 
    "happen in ferromagnetic material.", 
    "I take ferromagnetic material and I expose it", 
    "to an external field.", 
    "I call it a vacuum field.", 
    "So I stick it in a solenoid.", 
    "And I can choose the current through my solenoid.", 
    "And I'm going to plot for you the vacuum field.", 
    "This vacuum field is linearly proportional to the current", 
    "through my solenoid.", 
    "This is an actual physical solenoid.", 
    "They have a wire, and it goes around like this.", 
    "I don't have one here now.", 
    "And I run a current through there.", 
    "And that vacuum B field equals mu 0 times I times", 
    "N divided by l.", 
    "Except that this N divided by l is now the number of", 
    "windings of my current wire.", 
    "And this is the length of my solenoid.", 
    "So don't confuse it with the one we had there.", 
    "Because that was on an atomic scale, and this is on a", 
    "macroscopic scale.", 
    "How many windings you have could be-- well, you had a big", 
    "one here in class, 2,800 windings.", 
    "And we have 60 centimeters long.", 
    "And so that's what this number is all about.", 
    "So the moment that I know what the current is through my", 
    "solenoid, I immediately know what my vacuum field is.", 
    "A one-to-one correspondence.", 
    "And now I'm going to measure inside the ferromagnetic", 
    "material, which I stick in the solenoid.", 
    "I'm going to measure there the magnetic field.", 
    "And what's going to happen now?", 
    "Well, first of all, I cannot at all plot this curve on a", 
    "one-to-one scale.", 
    "The reason being that kappa of M for ferromagnetic material", 
    "is so large--", 
    "let us adopt for now a number of 1,000, say.", 
    "Or could be larger, even.", 
    "Let's say kappa of M is 1,000.", 
    "That means that if the magnetic field, in terms of a", 
    "vector, is this big, 1 centimeter in the length of", 
    "the vector, that the field inside the ferromagnetic", 
    "material is 1,000 times higher.", 
    "If this is 1 centimeter in length, 1,000 times", 
    "higher is 10 meters.", 
    "So this is the length of the vector of the magnetic field", 
    "inside the ferromagnetic material.", 
    "That's why I cannot do it to scale.", 
    "So when I draw this line here, keep in mind that", 
    "if I did it to scale--", 
    "if I did, but I can't--", 
    "then the tangent of alpha would be kappa of M. Which in", 
    "this case would be 10 to the third.", 
    "And so this angle alpha is something like", 
    "89.9-something degrees.", 
    "So I cannot do it to scale.", 
    "Keep that in mind.", 
    "So in the beginning, I get a nice linear curve.", 
    "But now slowly, I'm beginning to reach saturation that all", 
    "these dipoles are going to be aligned.", 
    "And what you're going to see is that this curve bends over", 
    "and bends over and bends over.", 
    "And the magnetic field that you finally achieve here is", 
    "the famous 2.3 Tesla, which I calculated for that imaginary", 
    "material plus B vacuum.", 
    "The 2.3 is now the field which I will call B prime.", 
    "This is the field that is the result of the alignment of all", 
    "those dipoles.", 
    "And so when I increase the vacuum field, this goes into", 
    "saturation and settles for 2.3 and can no longer increase", 
    "because I have aligned all these magnetic dipoles.", 
    "And so if your vacuum field is this strong, then this field", 
    "is no longer 1,000 times stronger", 
    "than the vacuum field.", 
    "You're no longer in the linear part.", 
    "So you could also think of it as kappa of M being smaller", 
    "than 1,000.", 
    "Whichever way you prefer is fine.", 
    "But it's no longer proportional to", 
    "the value of 1,000.", 
    "If the temperature is lower of the material, it's easier to", 
    "align them.", 
    "And so you'll achieve saturation earlier.", 
    "And so your curve would go like this.", 
    "So the curve is also a function of temperature.", 
    "So this is if the temperature is low relative to this one.", 
    "So these curves depend on temperature as well.", 
    "The lower the temperature, the easier it is to align them.", 
    "If I reach this point here, when my B prime goes into", 
    "saturation, I can only increase the B field in the", 
    "material by increasing the vacuum field.", 
    "Because B prime is not going to go up again.", 
    "And so I can only get a higher field by increasing this", 
    "current so that this B vacuum goes up.", 
    "And that goes up very slowly because this huge", 
    "magnification factor of 1,000 is gone now.", 
    "So the slow-- it's very slow, the growth.", 
    "And that's why you see it.", 
    "I drew it like this, that it increases very slowly.", 
    "But my plot is not to scale anyhow.", 
    "Now I want to discuss with you what happens with the material", 
    "once I have driven it into saturation.", 
    "What happens if now I change the current and I make my", 
    "vacuum field 0 again?", 
    "And now you get a very unusual behavior.", 
    "Let me do it here on the blackboard.", 
    "So I'll make a new drawing.", 
    "I could have continued with that one, but let", 
    "me make a new one.", 
    "So I'm going to do the following", 
    "experiment in my head.", 
    "I have a solenoid, and I run a current through that solenoid.", 
    "And if the current is in clockwise direction, my vacuum", 
    "fields will be in this direction.", 
    "And when the current is in counterclockwise direction, I", 
    "will assume that my vacuum field is in this direction.", 
    "So there is ferromagnetic material in here.", 
    "If the current flows in clockwise direction, the", 
    "vacuum field is in this direction.", 
    "If I run it in counterclockwise direction,", 
    "the vacuum field is in that direction.", 
    "And here is going to be my vacuum field.", 
    "It's easy for me to know what that is, because if I know the", 
    "current through my solenoid, this equation will immediately", 
    "tell me what the vacuum field is.", 
    "So I've never any problems with the vacuum field.", 
    "I stick a probe in here, and I measure the magnetic field", 
    "inside that material.", 
    "How we do that is not so easy, but we can do it.", 
    "There are a few things that I can't tell you.", 
    "This is one of them.", 
    "So here is the magnetic field inside the material.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So there we start.", 
    "We do the same thing that we did here.", 
    "So we approach the saturation.", 
    "But now when I'm here, I am reducing the current", 
    "and go back to 0.", 
    "Remember that when we are here, all these domains that", 
    "we discussed last time have all flipped in the direction", 
    "of the vacuum field.", 
    "So this field is enormous.", 
    "But now I make the current go back to 0.", 
    "And what happens now is I end up here, at this point P here.", 
    "The current now is 0.", 
    "There's no current going through the solenoid.", 
    "Notice the vacuum field is 0.", 
    "I can take the material out, the ferromagnetic material.", 
    "The material itself is now magnetic.", 
    "And you see there is a magnetic field inside it.", 
    "Why is that?", 
    "Because some of those domains remain aligned.", 
    "They don't go back.", 
    "And so we have created permanent magnetism.", 
    "And so at the location P, we have B vacuum is 0.", 
    "But B prime, which is the result of those aligned", 
    "magnetic moments, is still in this direction.", 
    "Nothing is to scale here, of course.", 
    "And so you still have a magnetic field.", 
    "Now I reverse the current.", 
    "I go counterclockwise.", 
    "So I'm creating a magnetic field", 
    "vacuum now in this direction.", 
    "And so now what will happen with this", 
    "curve, I come up here.", 
    "And look now here at this location Q.", 
    "What do I have now?", 
    "I have something very bizarre.", 
    "I have now a situation whereby the vacuum field is in this", 
    "direction, but there is no magnetic", 
    "field inside the material.", 
    "The magnetic field inside is 0.", 
    "So when we have point Q, so we have B vacuum is in this", 
    "direction, but B inside, B prime--", 
    "oh no, it's not B prime, it's B-- it's the total field", 
    "inside is 0.", 
    "The reason being that B prime is still in this direction.", 
    "The reason being that the domains are still aligned in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "And so the vacuum field, plus the B prime field, which has", 
    "to be vectorially added, adds up with a net field 0.", 
    "Quite bizarre, isn't it?", 
    "Now I increase the current, but I keep going", 
    "counterclockwise.", 
    "And so the magnetic field of the vacuum", 
    "remains in this direction.", 
    "I go into saturation again in a similar way that I went into", 
    "saturation here.", 
    "And now I stop here--", 
    "oh, I don't want to lose my broach--", 
    "and now I stop here.", 
    "And I say to the current, go back to 0 again.", 
    "So my current now goes back to 0.", 
    "And there we go.", 
    "And now I arrive here, point S. And again, I have a", 
    "situation that my vacuum field is 0.", 
    "I could take the material out of the solenoid, just walk", 
    "around with it on the street.", 
    "It will be a permanent magnet.", 
    "But now the magnetic field inside this material, in point", 
    "P it was in this direction.", 
    "If I take it out here, then it is in this direction.", 
    "Now some domains stay aligned in this direction.", 
    "The reason was that I have counterclockwise current.", 
    "And so those domains flipped over.", 
    "And they're not all willing to flip back again.", 
    "So I've also made a permanent magnet here.", 
    "Vacuum field 0, but B prime is now in the opposite direction.", 
    "And then, if I continue now to go clockwise with current", 
    "again and increase the current, I end up there.", 
    "And this is a bizarre curve.", 
    "We call this the hysteresis curve.", 
    "If you look at this curve, it's really amazing.", 
    "It's actually hard to digest this.", 
    "You have to give it a little bit of thought.", 
    "Because for one particular value of the current--", 
    "for instance, here.", 
    "Once I have a particular value of the current--", 
    "I know that B vacuum is a given--", 
    "I have two possibilities here for the magnetic field.", 
    "And for the current here, I have two possibilities for the", 
    "magnetic field.", 
    "And so I cannot even know when I take this material and I", 
    "expose it to an external field, I can't even calculate", 
    "what the magnetic field inside will be.", 
    "Depends on the history of this material.", 
    "Look at this point here and at this point there.", 
    "If I asked you, what is kappa of M, it's almost", 
    "a ridiculous question.", 
    "Because what is kappa of M?", 
    "I have a vacuum field, but I have no field inside.", 
    "So the field inside, which is B, is 0.", 
    "And the vacuum field is not 0.", 
    "So you would have to answer kappa M is 0.", 
    "That's the only thing you could say.", 
    "Quite bizarre, right?", 
    "But right here there is a vacuum field,", 
    "but no field inside.", 
    "So kappa M is 0 here, and kappa M is 0 here.", 
    "And remember, here it was 1,000.", 
    "Look at the situation.", 
    "Take this point of the curve and this point of the curve.", 
    "Kappa M is less than 0, is negative.", 
    "Because here the vacuum field is in this direction, but B", 
    "prime is in that direction.", 
    "So they're in opposite directions.", 
    "So the net field is in that direction, but B vacuum is in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "And here it's also reversed.", 
    "So it is a bizarre situation that you are effectively", 
    "having situations whereby kappa of M is 0.", 
    "And kappa of M can also be negative for those points that", 
    "I have there.", 
    "I can show you this hysteresis curve.", 
    "And I do it exactly the way that I explain to you, except", 
    "that I will not be able to run this current very", 
    "slowly up and down.", 
    "I do it with 60 Hertz alternating current, just get", 
    "it out of the wall.", 
    "And so I run through this solenoid 60", 
    "Hertz alternating current.", 
    "That means we go through this curve very quickly back and", 
    "forth between this point, maximum current, and this", 
    "point, maximum current.", 
    "The current clockwise, counterclockwise, clockwise,", 
    "counterclockwise.", 
    "And we change at 60 times per second.", 
    "And then I will show you this curve again, highly distorted.", 
    "I cannot plot it one to one for the reasons that I", 
    "explained to you.", 
    "And you will see then the hysteresis curve.", 
    "That's called the hysteresis curve.", 
    "And for that, I have to do several things.", 
    "And I always forget what I have to do, but just don't", 
    "worry about it.", 
    "I will find out.", 
    "My TV goes on.", 
    "This light goes off.", 
    "And this light goes off.", 
    "Look there, on the screen, and you will see within seconds,", 
    "there is the hysteresis curve.", 
    "And as I said to you earlier, I cannot start here,", 
    "unfortunately.", 
    "Because we switch it so fast back and forth that this part", 
    "of the curve, by the way, which is called", 
    "the virginal curve--", 
    "virginal because it's once and never again--", 
    "once you have reached that point, from that moment on,", 
    "you always stick to this.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "I know you should know about that.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "And so here you see a striking example of a hysteresis curve.", 
    "And so you can ask yourself now the question, can we make", 
    "this material virginal again?", 
    "And then the answer is yes.", 
    "There are various ways you can do that.", 
    "One way is you could take the material out.", 
    "So that means you take it out, for instance, when there is", 
    "remanent magnetism here.", 
    "So it's a magnet.", 
    "And now you heat it up above the Curie point, as we did", 
    "last time in my lecture.", 
    "And then the domains completely fall apart.", 
    "And then you cool it again below the Curie point.", 
    "And then it is virginal material again.", 
    "And then you could start here again.", 
    "That's one way you could do it.", 
    "There's another way you could try to do it.", 
    "You take a hammer and you just bang on it.", 
    "So you take it out.", 
    "And you have permanent magnetism,", 
    "either here or there.", 
    "And you bang on it.", 
    "And you hope for the best.", 
    "And maybe you can get it back to here.", 
    "There's another way which we call demagnetization.", 
    "And I think that's what happens when you steal a book", 
    "in the library and you try to get away with it.", 
    "And the alarm goes off.", 
    "Someone hasn't demagnetized the magnetic", 
    "strip in the book.", 
    "But you may have noticed that when you take it out, that", 
    "someone under the table goes like this.", 
    "And what they're doing then is they're", 
    "demagnetizing that strip.", 
    "And the way you do that is as follows.", 
    "Here the current goes back and forth between this value and", 
    "this value.", 
    "That means B vacuum and I are directly", 
    "coupled to each other.", 
    "So I think of this as being current.", 
    "And now I go up to here and then back.", 
    "And then here, and here, and here, and here, and here and", 
    "here and here and here, and I end up there again.", 
    "And I can show you that.", 
    "So again, you have alternating current.", 
    "But the amplitude of the current, you decrease, and", 
    "decrease, and decrease.", 
    "And you're going to see that there.", 
    "And you see that I can turn this material--", 
    "see, the hysteresis curve changes.", 
    "So the amplitude of the current is not as large.", 
    "So the amplitude of the B vacuum is not as large.", 
    "And I slowly go back.", 
    "And I can change a non-virgin back into a virgin.", 
    "And that's the way we do it as physicists.", 
    "Demagnetization.", 
    "Did I turn that off?", 
    "Yes, I did.", 
    "I have here a coil.", 
    "You can't see that there's a coil inside", 
    "here, but there is.", 
    "I can power this coil, put in a current through it.", 
    "Ferromagnetic material.", 
    "I don't know what kappa is, but at least 1,000.", 
    "I get an enormously strong field inside here.", 
    "And this field is so strong that this piece of", 
    "ferromagnetic material will be attracted.", 
    "The field is non-uniform outside, we discussed last", 
    "time, that it will go clunk.", 
    "It will stick there.", 
    "So let's do that.", 
    "So I powered this electromagnet.", 
    "You can't see that I did.", 
    "You have to take my word for it.", 
    "But you believe it now.", 
    "There is goes.", 
    "Oh boy.", 
    "The force is so large that I would ask two people to come", 
    "and see whether they can pull it apart.", 
    "The force that the two are together is so large that you", 
    "may not even be able to separate it.", 
    "Do we have two strong people?", 
    "One strong woman, one strong man.", 
    "You look very strong to me.", 
    "Come on.", 
    "It's not going to be a tug-of-war", 
    "between the two of you.", 
    "That's not my plan.", 
    "Be very careful, because if you touch this, you get", 
    "electrocuted.", 
    "So don't do that.", 
    "Make sure that everyone can see you.", 
    "Because there's a current running through", 
    "this solenoid now.", 
    "Yeah?", 
    "STUDENT 1: OK.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Now, just in case that you succeed, I don't", 
    "want you to get hurt.", 
    "So make sure that you secure yourself.", 
    "Because suppose the current stopped", 
    "running all of a sudden?", 
    "It's possible.", 
    "It's MIT, right?", 
    "Anything can happen.", 
    "Then, of course, it's no longer a strong magnet.", 
    "It's only a strong magnet as long as the current is running", 
    "through the solenoid.", 
    "So you secure yourself too.", 
    "STUDENT 2: OK.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: OK.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero, go.", 
    "Don't worry.", 
    "I knew that in advance.", 
    "But thank you very much.", 
    "Very kind of you.", 
    "Now comes something that you will understand.", 
    "If I make the current go to 0, then the vacuum", 
    "field goes to 0.", 
    "That means the field that is generated by the", 
    "solenoid goes to 0.", 
    "I will do that now in front of your own eyes.", 
    "No more current, right?", 
    "Why is this still hanging there?"
