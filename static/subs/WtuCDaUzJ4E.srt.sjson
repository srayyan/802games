    "WALTER LEWIN: If you take a piece of plane parallel glass,", 
    "which is window glass, then you're not", 
    "going to see colors.", 
    "Because if I shine light on here, white light from the", 
    "light bulbs or from the sun, it is true that it will", 
    "obviously refract in here.", 
    "But when you apply Snell's law again here, then it will come", 
    "out, all the colors will come out in the same direction.", 
    "So the red light comes out here, and the blue light comes", 
    "out in the same direction.", 
    "And your brains are very special.", 
    "If your brain see all colors coming from one direction,", 
    "they say, I see white light.", 
    "Look at the light bulb.", 
    "You say oh, that's white light.", 
    "But look at this gentleman.", 
    "You say hey, it's red.", 
    "It must come from that light bulb.", 
    "So your brains are special in the sense that they think that", 
    "the combination of many colors is white.", 
    "And I can show that to you in a rather convincing way.", 
    "You see here a disk.", 
    "And I would assume that you see colors on that disk.", 
    "If not, you have a problem.", 
    "And I can fool your brains.", 
    "What I can do, I can rotate that disk so fast that your", 
    "brains get so mixed up that they're going to say to you,", 
    "yeah, that's white light.", 
    "So let me first give you some ideal light on that disk, and", 
    "we're going to spin it up a little.", 
    "So you agree with me, right?", 
    "You still see colors, yeah?", 
    "You still see colors, right?", 
    "OK.", 
    "You still see colors, right?", 
    "Yeah.", 
    "[CHUCKLE]", 
    "This is white as it can be for me.", 
    "Not too surprising, right?", 
    "The same situation when I look at the light bulb.", 
    "All these colors are processed by my brains in such a way", 
    "that they think or they--", 
    "well, they actually make you see white light.", 
    "It's as real as you can have it.", 
    "And so this raises the subject of the illusion of colors,", 
    "which is what I want to discuss with you for the", 
    "remaining part of this lecture.", 
    "If you ask a physicist, when do you see certain colors?", 
    "When do we see red?", 
    "When do we see blue or green?", 
    "Then chances are that he would give you a standard answer.", 
    "And he would say well, that depends on the", 
    "wavelength in air.", 
    "If you tell me what wavelength you're on, then I will tell", 
    "you what colors you will see.", 
    "And I have here a transparency which makes the connection", 
    "between wavelength and these colors.", 
    "It's also on the web, so you can also download this.", 
    "And so if the wavelength of light in air is about in this", 
    "range, 1 Angstrom is 10 to the -10 meters, yeah, you will", 
    "probably say that's red light.", 
    "When the wavelengths get shorter, in this range, you", 
    "would say yeah, that's green light.", 
    "And when the wavelengths get even shorter, you would say", 
    "yeah, that's blue light.", 
    "You can't see any wavelengths shorter than this.", 
    "You get into the ultraviolet here.", 
    "You can't see any wavelengths longer than this.", 
    "That's infrared, and our eyes are not sensitive for those", 
    "wavelengths.", 
    "So this is all nice and dandy, but we still have the problem", 
    "of the fact that if you mix all those colors together,", 
    "like the rotating disk and like looking at the light", 
    "bulb, that our brains still tell us that we are seeing", 
    "white light.", 
    "So maybe matters are not really as simple as we think.", 
    "And this scheme about colors has been worked out in quite", 
    "some detail already in the 17th and in the 18th century,", 
    "when it was discovered that there is such a thing as", 
    "primary colors.", 
    "Maxwell did some research on that, and Helmholtz.", 
    "Even the poet Goethe did work on this.", 
    "They discovered that there are primary colors, and when you", 
    "mix light--", 
    "we call this additive mixing.", 
    "The three primary colors are green, violet, and red.", 
    "And when you mix paint, the three primary colors yellow,", 
    "blue, and red.", 
    "And the idea behind this is that if you mix the three", 
    "primary colors in the right proportion, that you can make", 
    "many colors.", 
    "I want to show you a color triangle, which is the recipe.", 
    "It tells you how you have to mix these colors.", 
    "And in order to do that, we're going to make it dark, but not", 
    "all the way dark.", 
    "So here you see your color triangle.", 
    "And the color triangle has, in the three colors--", 
    "the three corners, the colors red, one primary color.", 
    "And then here it has violet.", 
    "And then up there it has green.", 
    "And I'll tell you how this recipe has to be used.", 
    "So I'm going to draw here the color triangle.", 
    "And we have red here, and we have green there, and we have", 
    "here violet.", 
    "If you look at this color triangle, you see all the", 
    "colors that you can imagine--", 
    "sort of.", 
    "You see yellow.", 
    "And you see purple.", 
    "And you see orange.", 
    "You even see white.", 
    "So how do we make these colors now?", 
    "Well, suppose I want to make this color here.", 
    "So that's this color, say.", 
    "Then you draw three lines.", 
    "One, two, three, from the three corners.", 
    "And this is the amount of red that you have to put in.", 
    "And this is the amount of green that you have", 
    "to put in the light.", 
    "And this is the amount of violet light.", 
    "And if you do that in that ratio, you would get the color", 
    "which is here.", 
    "If you want to make very nice yellow--", 
    "let's see.", 
    "Let's make some very nice yellow, which is all the way", 
    "here at the edge.", 
    "You don't need any violet.", 
    "You can do that exclusively with green and with red.", 
    "So let's go to this point here, which is yellow.", 
    "It would mean then that I have to put in this much red, and I", 
    "have to put in this much green.", 
    "And if I add more and more red, I go along this line.", 
    "Then I end up here, and I get orange.", 
    "So I could make orange here by simply increasing", 
    "the amount of red.", 
    "Oh--", 
    "this should not be violet, right?", 
    "Uh-oh, this is green.", 
    "Oh, you should have yelled at me.", 
    "So this is green.", 
    "And so if I want to make orange here, then I simply", 
    "have to give it more red and less green.", 
    "And if you go to an extreme and you want to make white", 
    "light, and you go bingo right there in the middle, well", 
    "then, you have to give it this much red, this much green, and", 
    "this much violet.", 
    "And that's the idea that we just saw.", 
    "You mix all the colors, and we mix up your brains as well.", 
    "And your brains then say gee, that is white light.", 
    "So the idea behind the three primary color theory is that", 
    "our eye cells, the cells that we have in the retina, respond", 
    "differently to the three primary colors.", 
    "And that color sensation, which is of course what the", 
    "brains are telling you, those are the messages that are", 
    "being sent to the brain, and they're processed here.", 
    "That they are a result of the mixing of the three responses.", 
    "And the theory is quite successful.", 
    "I'm going to try to make for you the color yellow by mixing", 
    "these three colors, green and violet.", 
    "And if I want to make yellow, then we already argued, all I", 
    "need is green and I need red.", 
    "I don't even need violet.", 
    "And I'm going to do that with this nice little box here.", 
    "I will raise the screen, because we don't need the", 
    "screen anymore.", 
    "And I don't think I need the slide anymore, John.", 
    "And this box has three lights in there.", 
    "Red, green, violet.", 
    "And I can change the intensities.", 
    "I can show you.", 
    "I can make the red less strong, and I can do the same", 
    "with the green.", 
    "I can make it less strong.", 
    "And I can do the same with the violet.", 
    "And so if I want to make, for instance, that yellow, then I", 
    "could do that with green and red alone.", 
    "And I have to give it a lot of green and a little bit of red.", 
    "So little bit of red, and a lot of green.", 
    "Adjust it a little.", 
    "I see yellow.", 
    "Don't you?", 
    "Who sees yellow?", 
    "OK.", 
    "Shall we make it a little orange?", 
    "Then we have to give it a little bit more red.", 
    "I give it a little bit more red-- oh, it becomes orange.", 
    "So I'm marching now here, giving a little bit more red,", 
    "and you make it orange.", 
    "And what I can even do, I can give them all three the", 
    "maximum strength, and I can turn it to white.", 
    "So you fool the brains again.", 
    "All these colors, like the rotating disk.", 
    "Like the light from the sun, like the light", 
    "from the lights here.", 
    "I think I see white light.", 
    "Your color TV is based on this principle.", 
    "You have three electron guns in your color TV.", 
    "And there are three different chemicals on the screen of", 
    "your television.", 
    "And these chemicals are in the form of very small dots.", 
    "And if electrons hit one of these dots, they become", 
    "violet, and the other chemicals become green, and", 
    "the other chemicals become red.", 
    "And so the whole idea is that each beam gets its own", 
    "chemical dots.", 
    "That's the way they arrange things.", 
    "And by mixing the various intensities--", 
    "you can mix the intensities with three primary colors, and", 
    "you can see all colors on television.", 
    "It works very well.", 
    "Of course, if you haven't adjusted your television", 
    "properly, you may have noticed that sometimes faces are", 
    "reddish or faces are greenish.", 
    "Well, that's a matter of adjusting those three guns", 
    "appropriately, and then you can be very successful.", 
    "And it's very impressive.", 
    "This three color scheme works quite nicely.", 
    "So in many cases, the three primary color theory is quite", 
    "satisfactory.", 
    "But there are cases where it fails bitterly, and those are", 
    "the ones that I want to discuss for the remaining 10", 
    "minutes and 40 seconds.", 
    "Already in the 19th century, it was known that there were", 
    "problems with the three color theory.", 
    "Mr. Benham, in 1895, invented a top which", 
    "is named after him.", 
    "It's called the Benham top.", 
    "I have one in my office on my table.", 
    "It is a top that has just black lines on it-- no colors.", 
    "You rotate it and you see colors.", 
    "And we copied that top for you, and we have that here.", 
    "This is a copy.", 
    "It's a large copy.", 
    "The top is only this small, that I have.", 
    "This is a Benham top.", 
    "I hope you would agree with me to this is black and white.", 
    "Any one of you see colors, let me know now.", 
    "I will ask you to leave, then.", 
    "OK, so no one sees colors.", 
    "Good.", 
    "So now I'm going to rotate that for you, and you'll be", 
    "surprised what you're going to see.", 
    "So there is the Benham top, and I'm going to rotate it", 
    "somewhere in the ballpark of about 7 Hertz.", 
    "5 to 7 Hertz.", 
    "Let's take a look.", 
    "Black and white.", 
    "Hey, [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "What am I seeing?", 
    "I'm seeing colors.", 
    "Not very bright, but I am seeing colors!", 
    "I see some rusty brown right there in the middle, and then", 
    "I see something of a grayish green, maybe, and dark blue", 
    "further out.", 
    "Who sees colors?", 
    "Who doesn't?", 
    "Or, you're color blind, then.", 
    "That happens.", 
    "Well, you see colors just with black and white rotating.", 
    "And to make it even worse, I can reverse the disk.", 
    "I first have to stop it--", 
    "otherwise we burn out the motor.", 
    "And I can reverse, and remember the rusty brown was", 
    "in the center.", 
    "Now we're going to rotate it the other way around.", 
    "Look again what you see.", 
    "You're now seeing the rusty brown near the edge.", 
    "You see, the colors reversed.", 
    "A lot of research was done in these area, but a complete", 
    "neuro-physiological explanation is still not", 
    "available yet, even though there are several very", 
    "successful models that can predict what", 
    "our brains will see.", 
    "And when your color cells are stimulated with flicker light,", 
    "there are phase delays between incident", 
    "light and the response--", 
    "the messages that are sent to your brains, with are", 
    "currents, of course.", 
    "And the phase delay is different for different", 
    "colors, so what we're doing here, we", 
    "are fooling the brains.", 
    "We're sending flicker light to the brains with different", 
    "phase delays.", 
    "The phase delays in the center are different from the phase", 
    "delays further out, and so the brains then process that in", 
    "the usual way.", 
    "And they say well, I'm sorry, but you're", 
    "going to see colors.", 
    "And that's what you're seeing.", 
    "The most fabulous example of where the three color theory", 
    "fails, or at least is very incomplete, is the work done", 
    "by Edwin Land in the early '50s.", 
    "Edwin Land, very famous man.", 
    "He was the inventor of the Polaroid film.", 
    "He pioneered color theories and became very famous for a", 
    "particular demonstration that I will do for you here.", 
    "He gave me two slides.", 
    "I got them personally from Edwin Land.", 
    "And these two slides that I'm going to show you are black", 
    "and white slides.", 
    "That is non-negotiable.", 
    "I'm going to show them to you.", 
    "They're as black and white as this disk.", 
    "He took one of those slides by taking a", 
    "photograph of something.", 
    "And what that something is, you're", 
    "going to see very shortly.", 
    "And the other black and white slide, he also took again", 
    "black and white film, but he put a red filter in front of", 
    "his camera.", 
    "But believe me, it is a black and white slide.", 
    "So you're going to see two black and white slides.", 
    "And then I'm going to do something special with those", 
    "slides, and therefore I rather go there now and then explain", 
    "things to you as they come along.", 
    "And so I have to make it very dark.", 
    "Oh, the screen has to come down, of course.", 
    "We're going to need the screen, because we're going to", 
    "see slides.", 
    "So two black and white slides.", 
    "So the first black and white slide is this one.", 
    "I hope we will all agree that this is a", 
    "black and white slide.", 
    "And the second black and white slide is of the same scene.", 
    "This, by the way, was taken through a red filter.", 
    "But it is black and white.", 
    "The next one was not taken through a red filter, but I", 
    "hope we all agree, it's black and white.", 
    "If I put a red filter in front of this black and white slide,", 
    "you see exactly what you would have predicted--", 
    "namely, that it's like looking through a red piece of glass.", 
    "The whole world turns a little reddish.", 
    "Very boring, although some kids like that.", 
    "So this is what you're going to see.", 
    "I can do the same with the other one.", 
    "This is the one that Edwin Land photographed through a", 
    "red filter.", 
    "If I put a red filter in front of it, you're going to see", 
    "what you expect.", 
    "Reddish, pinkish colors.", 
    "What do you think you're going to see if we project one black", 
    "and white slide on top of the other black and white slide?", 
    "Well, let's face it.", 
    "Let's be down to earth.", 
    "Black and white plus black and white will", 
    "remain black and white.", 
    "And that's what you see now.", 
    "One is now on top of the other.", 
    "You may not notice that, but I'll take one", 
    "away and add it again.", 
    "Black and white plus black and white gives black and white.", 
    "Now I'm going to ask you to sit very firm in your chairs,", 
    "because you're going to fall off your chairs", 
    "if you're not careful.", 
    "I'm now going to put in front of the slide that Edwin Land", 
    "took through a red filter, I'm going to put a red filter in", 
    "front of my projector, only through that slide.", 
    "The other one remains as it was.", 
    "And there we go.", 
    "Now what do you see?", 
    "You see colors.", 
    "Is this is a miracle?", 
    "Maybe it is.", 
    "I see yellow here.", 
    "I see green here.", 
    "I see some dark blue.", 
    "Who also sees colors?", 
    "Just say yeah.", 
    "STUDENTS: Yeah.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Who doesn't?", 
    "Good for you.", 
    "Isn't this amazing?", 
    "Two black and white slides--", 
    "that's all you're seeing.", 
    "And then you see this silly red filter, which normally", 
    "would give you only a little bit of pinkish, reddish light.", 
    "But when you put one on top of the other, something bizarre", 
    "is happening in your brains.", 
    "Your brains are so incredibly mixed up that they really", 
    "think you're seeing yellow there, and they really make", 
    "you think that you're seeing green there.", 
    "A reasonable question now is to ask if we took a picture of", 
    "this, you take your camera with color film,", 
    "what will you see?", 
    "Will you keep colors or will it be black and white?", 
    "Yes, you will see colors, but the colors will be different", 
    "from the way that you and I perceive them right now.", 
    "So now you can ask yourself the question, well, what are", 
    "now the real colors?", 
    "The ones that you and I see, or the ones that our picture", 
    "will record?", 
    "Well, I think that's a meaningless question.", 
    "There is no such thing as right or wrong in this matter.", 
    "Our brains are very complicated, and whatever they", 
    "show us, that's the real thing for us.", 
    "Reality is very relative.", 
    "And if you're color blind, which quite a few people in my", 
    "audience must be, just a matter of statistics, then", 
    "they have a different reality altogether.", 
    "Reality is only in the mind of the beholder, and it all", 
    "depends on how your brains are processing messages.", 
    "The message that I'm giving you for this weekend is, have", 
    "a good time, but by all means start working on your Exam 3,", 
    "which certainly is not an illusion."
