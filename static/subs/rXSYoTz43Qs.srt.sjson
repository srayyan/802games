    "WALTER LEWIN: There are many key practical applications in", 
    "LRC circuits, more than you may think.", 
    "You're radio and your TV are systems that you, without", 
    "realizing it, you tune them to resonance.", 
    "There's an antenna, and that receives many, many stations", 
    "at all different frequencies.", 
    "And in general, you change the capacitor.", 
    "And when you change the capacitor in the LRC circuit,", 
    "you're changing the resonance frequency.", 
    "And at that resonance frequency, the system is very", 
    "sensitive, drives a very high current, and it selects, then,", 
    "a particular station at that frequency.", 
    "That's what you're doing with your TV.", 
    "And that's what you're doing with your radio.", 
    "You're changing a variable capacitor.", 
    "Another application which is quite", 
    "common are metal detectors.", 
    "Metal detectors are resonant circuits.", 
    "They are set at resonance, and then when you bring metal", 
    "nearby, you move them off resonance.", 
    "And then the alarm goes.", 
    "In general, they have two coils.", 
    "This is one coil.", 
    "And this is another coil.", 
    "Inductance L1, resistor R1, capacitance C1, L2, R2, C2.", 
    "So there's a current I1 running through this one, a", 
    "current I2 running through that one.", 
    "To set up the differential equations for this system is", 
    "not so easy.", 
    "You get two differential equations, of course, one for", 
    "this system and one for this system.", 
    "The problem but, at the same time, the trick is that there", 
    "is a mutual inductance between the two.", 
    "Because when this one produces a current I2, there is a", 
    "magnetic flux going through this one.", 
    "That's why we call it mutual inductance, which we have", 
    "never really dealt with in any detail in 8.02, and we won't.", 
    "But I want to mention that this differential equation", 
    "here is an equation in I1, L1, R1, C1, but also contains a", 
    "term M times dI2/dt.", 
    "And this differential equation is an equation in L2, R2, C2,", 
    "I2, but also contains a term M times dI1/dt.", 
    "And so now you get two coupled differential equations.", 
    "It's not just one in I1 and one I2.", 
    "It is one in I1 and I2, and it is another one in I1 and I2.", 
    "And that is a pain in the neck.", 
    "And it's not easy to solve.", 
    "But there are mathematicians who can do all that.", 
    "And they solve that for us physicists.", 
    "In any case, what is important to note is clearly, since you", 
    "have two coils, you get two resonant frequencies--", 
    "not just one, but you have two resonant frequencies.", 
    "And at least one of those resonant frequencies depends", 
    "very strongly on the mutual inductance.", 
    "And so the system is tuned to sit at one of these two", 
    "resonant frequencies.", 
    "And now someone brings in metal.", 
    "You bring in a chunk of metal.", 
    "And in this metal, the metal will experience the magnetic", 
    "field flux changes.", 
    "It's AC, of course, always.", 
    "In the metal it will start building up eddy currents.", 
    "And so the eddy currents will change the magnetic coupling", 
    "between these two loops.", 
    "And so M changes.", 
    "And when M changes, you go off resonance, and, bingo, your", 
    "alarm goes off.", 
    "Clearly, and very unfortunately, this never", 
    "works for plastic bombs.", 
    "You must have conducting material that you bring in, so", 
    "it must be a metal.", 
    "These systems have very high Q. Very high Q means they are", 
    "extremely sensitive.", 
    "If you have very high Q, that curve is extremely narrow.", 
    "And so the slightest change in M, you go off resonance, and", 
    "you get your alarm.", 
    "And so they come in various forms and in various", 
    "applications.", 
    "At the airport it is very simple.", 
    "You walk through these two coils.", 
    "You may not have realized that, but", 
    "you simply walk through.", 
    "You walks through like there's one coil here, one coil there,", 
    "and that's how they detect whether you have", 
    "any metal on you.", 
    "The ones, the metal detectors that are used to search you", 
    "body, including the ones that are used to search the ground", 
    "for coins--", 
    "when I was a kid, I went off into the beach in the", 
    "Netherlands.", 
    "And there were often people who were", 
    "having these metal detectors.", 
    "They were looking for coins.", 
    "And those metal detectors, it's basically the same idea--", 
    "always two coils.", 
    "This is this coil, and this is this coil.", 
    "And when metal comes nearby, you have a system that goes", 
    "off resonance.", 
    "You get a different magnetic coupling", 
    "between the two coils.", 
    "And the system goes into alarm.", 
    "And I'd like to demonstrate that, for", 
    "which I need a student.", 
    "Any student who wants to volunteer, I have here a metal", 
    "detector, and thank goodness we don't have to go through", 
    "metal detectors yet at MIT.", 
    "You want to volunteer?", 
    "Boy, you're brave.", 
    "You're all the way at the end of the--", 
    "I can't wait what you have in store for us.", 
    "Well you look like you're made of steel.", 
    "OK, I hope you left all your secret weapons up there.", 
    "Did you?", 
    "So this is a metal detector, and if you open this up here,", 
    "you would see two coils, one in the center, and", 
    "one near the edge.", 
    "And here we have to, I have to calibrate it first, OK.", 
    "Oh, you left your cigarettes out there?", 
    "They won't record.", 
    "What did you leave out there, I'm just curious.", 
    "Oh, you're afraid that it will get damaged?", 
    "Oh, we hear nothing.", 
    "STUDENT: That's definitely not working.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: No, that's probably not working, well,", 
    "just a second.", 
    "I may have to recalibrate this.", 
    "Pretty quiet.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Doesn't look like you have any metal there.", 
    "I'm fairly sure I turned it on.", 
    "They don't always work, do they?", 
    "Marcos, you have any wisdom on that?", 
    "Ha, it's working.", 
    "Ah, it's not working very well.", 
    "It's working well here.", 
    "I'm wonder what you've got there.", 
    "Are you metal?", 
    "Is this not made of metal, all these things here?", 
    "STUDENT: I have lots of metal on me.", 
    "And I'm surprised it's only going off at the belt buckle.", 
    "That's weird.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Oh, you may be a weird person.", 
    "That may be--", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Hey, turn around.", 
    "That's your watch.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]",
