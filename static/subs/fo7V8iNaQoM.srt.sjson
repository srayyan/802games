    "WALTER LEWIN: A very interesting, very interesting problem.", 
    "Here is 6 ohm.", 
    "I call this point P. Here is 3 ohm.", 
    "I will delete the word ohm, the symbol ohm.", 
    "This is 3 ohm.", 
    "Switch S. It continues here.", 
    "3 ohm.", 
    "6 ohm.", 
    "This point connected to a battery, plus, minus, 36 volts.", 
    "All the way back to point P. And that's the circuit.", 
    "And as we start, S is open.", 
    "And you are being asked, what is the potential difference between this", 
    "point a and this point b?", 
    "If the switch is open, there's no current flowing through here.", 
    "There is 36 volts over here.", 
    "There is 9 ohm here in series.", 
    "So Ohm's Law immediately tells me that the current through here is 4 amperes.", 
    "Here is also 9 ohm.", 
    "So also the current through both these two, I, is also 4 amperes.", 
    "And no current through here.", 
    "What is V P minus V a?", 
    "V P minus V a.", 
    "P is a higher potential than a.", 
    "4 ampere, 6 ohm.", 
    "So that is +24 volts.", 
    "What is V P minus V b?", 
    "V P minus V b.", 
    "This has a higher potential than this, 3 ohms, 4 amperes.", 
    "That is +12 volts.", 
    "So if you want to know the potentials, this is 36.", 
    "This jump is 24.", 
    "So that leaves this with 12.", 
    "0 here.", 
    "This jump is 12.", 
    "So that leaves this with plus 24.", 
    "And this jump is 0.", 
    "So here you see the four potentials at these four positions.", 
    "And so it's immediately obvious that V a minus V b equals 12 minus", 
    "24, equals -12 volts.", 
    "So therefore if you throw the switch, clearly there's going to be a current", 
    "going through here.", 
    "That is inevitable.", 
    "And that's exactly what we are going to do.", 
    "We're going to close the switch.", 
    "And we want to know, what is the current through", 
    "that horizontal section?", 
    "Now I will make a slightly different drawing, not because there was", 
    "anything wrong with the previous one, but I just feel like making a", 
    "different drawing.", 
    "I don't want to get bored.", 
    "So when you don't want to get bored, you do something different.", 
    "This is that point P. This is that point a.", 
    "This is the point b.", 
    "Circuit, no change.", 
    "3 ohms.", 
    "Here 6 ohms.", 
    "This point is going back, 36 volt battery, to this point.", 
    "And you will convince yourself that this circuit is completely identical.", 
    "Now let current i go through in here.", 
    "And let the current split here between i 1 and i 2.", 
    "So I always know that i equals i 1 plus i 2.", 
    "I make now the assumption, which could be wrong, that there's also a current", 
    "flowing in this direction, which I call i 3.", 
    "If I find i 3 later to be negative, no sweat.", 
    "It means that the current is flowing in the opposite direction.", 
    "So that's no problem.", 
    "When I come to this point here, if i 2 is coming in and i 3 is going out--", 
    "oh, excuse me.", 
    "I wanted--", 
    "forgive me.", 
    "I call this i 2.", 
    "And I call this i 1.", 
    "And I realize that it makes no difference.", 
    "But since that's the way I have made my notations, I would", 
    "like to stick to that.", 
    "So I call this i 1.", 
    "And I call this i 2.", 
    "So i 1 comes in.", 
    "i 3 comes out.", 
    "So then there's only one way that upwards must go i 1 minus i 3.", 
    "And if this number i 1 minus i 3 is positive, then indeed there will be a", 
    "current in this direction.", 
    "If it is negative, then there will be a current going in this direction.", 
    "Now we come to this point A. i 2 is coming in.", 
    "i 1 is coming in.", 
    "And i 3, negative.", 
    "So therefore, I have here minus i 3.", 
    "So that's the current through this resistor.", 
    "But now what's at this point?", 
    "i 1 plus i 2 minus i 3 plus i 3.", 
    "So what comes out here is i 1 plus i 2, which is exactly i.", 
    "And so my symbols are internally completely consistent.", 
    "And so what I have to find now is I have to find three equations, Craig,", 
    "with three unknowns.", 
    "I want to know what i 1 is, what i 2 is, and what i 3 is.", 
    "And then, of course, I also know i, because I know that i is i 1", 
    "plus i 2 plus i 3.", 
    "And so I have to apply Kirchhoff's Law three times in an independent fashion", 
    "so that I can get, in a relatively quick way, i 1, i 2, and i 3.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Where do we start?", 
    "And in what direction are we going to march?", 
    "I suggest that we start here.", 
    "And I suggest that we're going in this direction, counterclockwise.", 
    "And I suggest that our first journey--", 
    "you could, of course, choose any other journey, but I suggest that our first", 
    "journey is going to be all the way through the top and back.", 
    "All the way through the top and back.", 
    "Ready for that?", 
    "Uphill.", 
    "First I'm going to make a little easy table, i 1, i 2, and i 3.", 
    "I go uphill 36 volts.", 
    "So I have here +36.", 
    "I go downhill 6 times i 2, so I get a -6 here.", 
    "You must multiply that by i 2.", 
    "I go downhill 3 i 1, -3.", 
    "Downhill 3 i 2, -3.", 
    "Uphill 3 i 3, therefore +3, because remember, this is a minus sign.", 
    "And I come out here.", 
    "And I'm finished.", 
    "This is zero.", 
    "What now is my second loop going to be?", 
    "Well, take your pick.", 
    "I have decided to take the lower one.", 
    "I could have picked another one, but I'm going to take the lower one.", 
    "You ready for the lower one?", 
    "36.", 
    "I go through here.", 
    "I go down 3 i 1, -3.", 
    "I come here.", 
    "I go down in potential 6 i 3, -6.", 
    "I have a 0 here.", 
    "Ha.", 
    "There is no i 2.", 
    "And that equals 0.", 
    "Now I have to choose a third loop.", 
    "And for my third loop watch me carefully.", 
    "I could pick this one.", 
    "I could pick this one.", 
    "I could have picked this one.", 
    "But I'm going to pick this one, through here, through here, up here,", 
    "down here, this way, and back here.", 
    "Why not?", 
    "I can choose any one I want to.", 
    "Why not do that one?", 
    "36.", 
    "That's this one.", 
    "-6 i 2.", 
    "Now careful.", 
    "i 1 is coming towards me.", 
    "That means I'm going up in potential because of i 1.", 
    "So that is +3.", 
    "But it's going to be -3 for i 3.", 
    "Now I'm here.", 
    "I'm going down 6 i 3, so I have another -6 here.", 
    "And I come out here.", 
    "And this equals 0.", 
    "Well, three equations with three unknowns.", 
    "You have to multiply them, of course. so this is 36 minus 3 i 1 minus 9 i 2", 
    "plus 3 i 3 equals 0.", 
    "And you can solve these three equations with three unknowns.", 
    "I have a little bit extra time.", 
    "And I will help you a little, although I'm not going to solve them for you.", 
    "I'm going to divide them all by 3.", 
    "So I will get 12, -1, -3, +1, 0; 12, -1, 0, -2, 0; 12, +1, -2, -3, 0.", 
    "I call this Equation 1, Equation 2, and Equation 3.", 
    "And what is interesting, that if you subtract 1 from 2, so 2 minus 1, if", 
    "you subtract this one from this one, you find immediately that", 
    "i 2 equals i 3.", 
    "And that's not so obvious.", 
    "And when I found that, I said to myself, maybe there is a", 
    "faster way to see that.", 
    "And so I went back to this diagram.", 
    "And I looked, why?", 
    "Is there any obvious reasons why this current here is the same as this", 
    "current here?", 
    "Well, there is a lot of symmetry.", 
    "This is a 6.", 
    "This is a 6.", 
    "This is a 3.", 
    "This is a 3.", 
    "But then there is a 3 here.", 
    "I'm very frank with you.", 
    "I could not find an obvious reason why i 2 is i 3.", 
    "If you do, I would be very obliged and very grateful if you give me a call", 
    "and you let me know.", 
    "In any case, you can massage these three equations.", 
    "And I think I found that i 1 is something like 5.14 amperes.", 
    "And I think I find i 2 equals i 3 equals 3.43 amperes.", 
    "Three equations with three unknowns you have to solve.", 
    "Now you have to know what is the current through i S. That, of course,", 
    "is i 1 minus i 3.", 
    "And if this turns out to be positive, then the current is indeed going up.", 
    "And it is indeed going up, because you find that is 1.71 amperes.", 
    "And so the current through that resistor 3 is indeed", 
    "in the upwards direction."
