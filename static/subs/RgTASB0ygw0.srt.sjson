    "WALTER LEWIN: Because that total field is then the", 
    "integral of dB, vectorially, over the entire wire, so the", 
    "entire loop.", 
    "So if you go there--", 
    "so you would get your mu 0 divided by 4 pi.", 
    "You get your current, and you get your 1 over R squared.", 
    "And now you have to do an integral over that dl cross r.", 
    "Well, r is, of course, always perpendicular to dl.", 
    "Any element dl that you choose, the unit vector, r, is", 
    "exactly perpendicular to the element dl because that's the", 
    "characteristic of a circle.", 
    "And so the sine of the angle between dl and r is 1.", 
    "And so all we have to do is do an integral over dl, which is", 
    "the integral of this circle, which is the circumference of", 
    "the circle, and that is 2 pi R.", 
    "And so now you find you lose a pi.", 
    "You lose an R. So you find mu 0 times I divided by 2 R. Just", 
    "to show you an example how, in this case, how easy it is to", 
    "use Biot-Savart and calculate the magnetic field right at", 
    "the center.", 
    "If you were asked what the magnetic field was here or", 
    "there, that would be also relatively easy.", 
    "You've done that.", 
    "I've given you a problem earlier where we had point", 
    "charges uniformly distributed on a wire.", 
    "And I asked you what the electric field was here.", 
    "So that can also be done with a magnetic field.", 
    "If I ever asked you what the magnetic field would be here,", 
    "that, of course, is an impossibility to do that with", 
    "Biot-Savart, practically an impossibility.", 
    "I wouldn't know how to do that.", 
    "But in principle, it could be done, and certainly with a", 
    "computer you can do it.", 
    "So we can go to our same situation.", 
    "We can take 100 amperes for I. And you can take R 0.1 meters.", 
    "And then the B field, the strength of the B field right", 
    "at the center of this loop, that I found is then 6 times", 
    "10 to the minus 4 tesla.", 
    "And that would be 6 gauss.", 
    "It's clear that if you want to put in some field lines,", 
    "magnetic field lines as a result of this current going", 
    "around in a circle, that through the center there would", 
    "be a field line like so.", 
    "If you're very close to the wire here, which goes into the", 
    "blackboard--", 
    "I want you to see this three dimensionally--", 
    "then a magnetic field would go like this, clockwise.", 
    "Here the current comes to you, so it would be", 
    "counterclockwise.", 
    "If the magnetic field line is here like so, and here it is", 
    "curled up, then clearly I expect them to be here sort of", 
    "like so and like so and like so.", 
    "This is the kind of magnetic field line configuration that", 
    "I would expect then in the vicinity of", 
    "such a current loop.", 
    "And I want to show this to you in a little bit more detail.", 
    "I have here a transparency.", 
    "And you see there, on the right side, the current goes", 
    "into the paper, and here it comes out of the paper.", 
    "It is a circular loop.", 
    "And you see here the field line configuration.", 
    "It's not too different from what I have on", 
    "the blackboard there.", 
    "Very close to the wires, of course, you get circles", 
    "because the 1 over R dominates there.", 
    "You're so close to the wire that the 1 over R relationship", 
    "makes it come out like circles, and here, too.", 
    "But then if you're farther away, you get configurations", 
    "like I have there.", 
    "When you're very far away from a current loop, the magnetic", 
    "field configuration is very similar to that", 
    "of an electric dipole.", 
    "And I can show you that in the following way.", 
    "Let's first look at the electric dipole", 
    "that you see up there.", 
    "This is a positive charge.", 
    "This is a negative charge.", 
    "Don't look anywhere near the charges.", 
    "Don't look in between the charges.", 
    "Look far way.", 
    "Here you see electric field lines, and you see them here.", 
    "Now look at your current loop here.", 
    "The current is going into the paper here.", 
    "Coming out of the paper, it is a loop.", 
    "And look, you see the same configuration, field lines,", 
    "field lines.", 
    "This goes like so.", 
    "This one goes like so.", 
    "Here, the electric field lines coming in, magnetic field", 
    "lines are coming in.", 
    "Electric field lines are going out, magnetic field", 
    "lines are going out.", 
    "They look very similar.", 
    "Gauss Law tells me that the closed surface integral of the", 
    "electric flux is the charge inside the box", 
    "divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "And so, if you have a closed surface here-- it looks like a", 
    "line but I meant it to be a surface--", 
    "then that closed surface integral of the electric flux", 
    "is not 0 because there's a charge inside the box.", 
    "No matter where in the magnetic field you make a", 
    "closed surface, there is never any magnetic flux going", 
    "through that surface.", 
    "Never, unless you come into 26-100 and show", 
    "me a magnetic monopole.", 
    "Only then will there be magnetic flux coming out of a", 
    "closed surface, if we put the magnetic monopole inside.", 
    "And this now brings us to the second of four Maxwell's", 
    "equations, the first one being Gauss' Law.", 
    "The second one is that the closed surface integral of B", 
    "dot dA is always 0, unless you come with a magnetic monopole.", 
    "So we now have two of Maxwell's four equations in", 
    "place, historic day.", 
    "I want to show you the magnetic field in the vicinity", 
    "of a wire like this.", 
    "I have to use a few 100 amperes through that wire.", 
    "I told you why-- because magnetic field", 
    "falls off quite rapidly.", 
    "And I'll do that with iron file, which I will sprinkle", 
    "around the wire, and these magnetites will orient", 
    "themselves in that magnetic field.", 
    "And then I will try to also make you see this field", 
    "configuration by having one wire going into the paper and", 
    "one coming out of the paper.", 
    "So let's first look at the single current wire.", 
    "It's coming towards you and it goes into, of course.", 
    "It is a wire that goes like this.", 
    "And the reason why you see it here is, of course, we have to", 
    "get the current in somehow.", 
    "But it really is a wire like this, and this platform I'm", 
    "going to show you.", 
    "So I'm going to put some iron file around this.", 
    "These are magnetites.", 
    "And when they see a magnetic field, they will try to orient", 
    "themselves in the direction of the magnetic field.", 
    "So you're going to see these circles.", 
    "But appreciate the fact that you need huge currents for", 
    "this, hundreds of amperes we do.", 
    "That's why we have a car battery here, remember, that", 
    "was capable of delivering many hundreds of amperes.", 
    "So I close the current now.", 
    "I tap, and you can see the circular configuration.", 
    "I hope you can see that, looks like circles.", 
    "I want to do the same now, which is a little bit more", 
    "exciting, perhaps, with one wire going into the plane and", 
    "the other one coming out.", 
    "Even though it's not a circle, the idea is that you get a", 
    "field configuration very much like you see there.", 
    "Boy, it's already hot.", 
    "These cables are really hot.", 
    "They don't like the few hundred amperes.", 
    "OK, let's do it this way.", 
    "So you're going to see a field configuration similar to what", 
    "I have on the blackboard, similar to what you have here.", 
    "Oh no, not this one.", 
    "Similar to this.", 
    "Yeah, actually it was also the one I had.", 
    "But this is a nicer way to look at it.", 
    "So we have one wire going in and one wire", 
    "coming out of the plane.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So, let's first put some iron file on.", 
    "All right.", 
    "And now, a few hundred amperes through it.", 
    "Tap it, and you can see, close to the wire that goes in, here", 
    "and here, you see circles.", 
    "Goes with the 1 over R relationship.", 
    "They dominate the magnetic field.", 
    "But look in between here.", 
    "With a little bit of imagination, you can see these", 
    "field lines going like this, just like I have there on the", 
    "blackboard.", 
    "All right.", 
    "We don't need this anymore, and we", 
    "don't need that anymore."
