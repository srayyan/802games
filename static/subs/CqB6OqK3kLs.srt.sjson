    "WALTER LEWIN: Now, I come to a third way of polarization.", 
    "There is a third way we can make 100% linear polarized", 
    "light by the scattering of unpolarized light.", 
    "And we have to scatter off very fine particles, much", 
    "smaller than 1/10th of a micron.", 
    "Dust particles would work very well.", 
    "The theory of light scattering is extremely complicated.", 
    "But I will be able to convince you that if I scatter the", 
    "light over an angle of 90 degrees--", 
    "so it comes in like this and it scatters over an angle of", 
    "90 degrees--", 
    "that it becomes 100% linearly polarized.", 
    "I will stay on the center board.", 
    "Suppose I have light coming in like so.", 
    "And I have one light photon.", 
    "I concentrate on one to start with.", 
    "And it happens to be that that light photon is linearly", 
    "polarized in this direction.", 
    "And so, the E vector is oscillating like this.", 
    "Later, we're going to add all directions that we want.", 
    "I just pick one now.", 
    "And here are my fine dust particles.", 
    "And these dust particles have electrons.", 
    "And the electric field passes by.", 
    "And these electrons, which are charged, are going to", 
    "oscillate in this direction.", 
    "They're going to experience an acceleration, which is the", 
    "force that they experience divided by their mass.", 
    "And therefore, that is the charge that they have times", 
    "the electric field divided by their mass.", 
    "And so as this electric field vector--", 
    "this electric field component--", 
    "oscillating with frequency omega is passing by these", 
    "electrons, they themselves are going to oscillate with", 
    "frequency omega.", 
    "And this is the acceleration they will experience.", 
    "Notice that the electrons will experience a way higher", 
    "acceleration than the protons, because the protons have a", 
    "mass which is more than 1,800 times", 
    "larger than the electrons.", 
    "So whatever follows, it's really the electrons that do", 
    "the job and not the protons.", 
    "So we have charges that move up and down.", 
    "And now comes the question which we", 
    "have discussed earlier.", 
    "So this is just simply to refresh your memory.", 
    "If you're here at point P, in what direction will you now", 
    "see electromagnetic radiation that is produced by charges", 
    "that are being accelerated?", 
    "We discussed that earlier, and we even had", 
    "a movie about that.", 
    "And perhaps you will remember that the electric field at", 
    "point P is now oscillating in this direction.", 
    "A spherical wave goes out if I accelerate charges here.", 
    "And the rules about this direction of the electric", 
    "field are very simple.", 
    "E is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation,", 
    "which is the position vector.", 
    "I call this the position vector r.", 
    "And the second rule is that a, r, and E are in one plane.", 
    "And that happens to be, in this case, the plane of my", 
    "blackboard.", 
    "But of course, that doesn't have to be the plane of the", 
    "blackboard, because I can choose my point P in space", 
    "here, and these rules still apply.", 
    "The incident photon, which in this case, I picked only one,", 
    "is completely destroyed.", 
    "It is absorbed by the dust.", 
    "And the electrons which are going to radiate--", 
    "reradiate a photon at exactly the same frequency.", 
    "Because if this is oscillating with angular frequency omega,", 
    "then the acceleration would be with angular frequency omega.", 
    "And so this E field will have angular frequency omega.", 
    "So it really is as if the photon comes in and takes off", 
    "in a different direction.", 
    "That's why we call this scattering.", 
    "So the frequency remains the same, but", 
    "the direction changes.", 
    "And the probability that that photon will go in this", 
    "direction or this direction is 0, because you remember that", 
    "no electromagnetic wave is propagated in the direction of", 
    "the acceleration.", 
    "There's a high probability that it goes out in this", 
    "plane, perpendicular to a.", 
    "And at this angle theta, the probability is a little lower.", 
    "We discussed that earlier.", 
    "Now, I'm going to convince you why light that scatters over", 
    "90 degrees--", 
    "that comes in like this and then comes to you--", 
    "why that is 100% linearly polarized.", 
    "Here is a beam of light.", 
    "And this beam of light is unpolarized.", 
    "That means if I look down on this beam, you", 
    "have individual photons.", 
    "And I describe through those--", 
    "maybe a little bit artificially,", 
    "but I will do that.", 
    "It was successful with Malus' law.", 
    "I describe through them individual directions of", 
    "polarization.", 
    "So each photon on its own has a uniquely defined direction", 
    "of polarization.", 
    "It is a picture that is not kosher.", 
    "You really need quantum mechanics to do this right,", 
    "but on the other hand, the result that you find is", 
    "probably correct.", 
    "You will find the same results if you did it in a quantum", 
    "mechanical way.", 
    "So here, you have these dust particles.", 
    "And so what is going to happen is this light comes in and", 
    "then one may be scattered in this direction, another one in", 
    "this direction, another one in forward direction.", 
    "Now, you can go in all directions as you please.", 
    "I'm now going to look in the plane perpendicular to the", 
    "blackboard, because in the plane perpendicular to the", 
    "blackboard, every photon that ends up there is", 
    "at 90 degrees angle.", 
    "It comes in like this.", 
    "That is 90 degrees.", 
    "This is 90 degrees.", 
    "This is also 90 degrees.", 
    "And here is that plane.", 
    "I'll just draw a circle, but there is nothing special about", 
    "the circle.", 
    "And so the photons come now straight to you perpendicular", 
    "to the blackboard.", 
    "That's the picture that I have now in mind.", 
    "And let's say you were looking here.", 
    "So you are sitting there, so you have to lift this up,", 
    "because you're really sitting there.", 
    "But this is where you are.", 
    "And let's take one photon that comes in, which happens to be", 
    "linearly polarized in this direction.", 
    "We pick one photon, but it's unpolarized light, because", 
    "we're going to add so many photons that, on average,", 
    "there is no preferred direction.", 
    "But I pick one to start with.", 
    "And now, I ask myself the question if that photon is", 
    "scattered in your direction--", 
    "this direction--", 
    "how is the E vector oscillating here?", 
    "So this is now the position vector r, and this is the", 
    "direction a in which the electrons are going to shake.", 
    "Because the photon comes in with an E field shaking like", 
    "this, so the electrons are going to shake like this.", 
    "And you will immediately conclude that the electric", 
    "vector here must be oscillating like this.", 
    "Why?", 
    "Because it has to be perpendicular to r, which it", 
    "is, and it has to be in the plane of a and r.", 
    "There is only one solution.", 
    "And then, this is the correct solution.", 
    "Now, there is the next photon coming in.", 
    "And the next photon--", 
    "I'll give it color just to distinguish the two--", 
    "happens to be oscillating in this direction."
