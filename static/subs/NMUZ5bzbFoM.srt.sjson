    "WALTER LEWIN: I now remove the power supply that I used to", 
    "give it a certain potential difference.", 
    "I completely take it away.", 
    "So that means this charge here is trapped, can not change.", 
    "But now I move in a dielectric.", 
    "I move in one of those substances.", 
    "And what you're going to see here now at the top, you're", 
    "going to see a negative induced layer.", 
    "And at the bottom, you're going to see a positive", 
    "induced layer.", 
    "I called it plus sigma induced, and I call this minus", 
    "sigma induced.", 
    "And the only reason why I call the other free is to", 
    "distinguish them from the induced charge.", 
    "This induced charge, which I have in green, will produce an", 
    "electric field which is in the opposite direction, and I call", 
    "that E induced.", 
    "And clearly E free is, of course, the surface charge", 
    "density divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "And E induced is the induced surface charge density divided", 
    "by epsilon 0.", 
    "And so the net E field is the vectorial sum of the two.", 
    "So E net, I give it the vector, is E free plus E", 
    "induced, vectorially added.", 
    "Since I'm interested--", 
    "I know the direction already-- since I'm interested in", 
    "magnitudes, therefore, the strength of the net E field is", 
    "going to be the strength of the E fields created by the", 
    "so-called free charge minus the strength of the E field", 
    "created by the induced charge.", 
    "Minus because this E factor is down and this one", 
    "is in the up direction.", 
    "And so, if I now make the assumption that a certain", 
    "fraction of the free charge is induced, so I make the", 
    "assumption that sigma induced is some fraction", 
    "b times sigma free.", 
    "I just write now an \"i\" for induced and an \"f\" for free.", 
    "b is smaller than 1.", 
    "If b were 0.1, it means that sigma induced would be 10% of", 
    "sigma free.", 
    "That's the meaning of b.", 
    "So, clearly, if this is the case, then also E of i must", 
    "also be b times E of f.", 
    "You can tell immediately they're connected.", 
    "And so, now I can write down, for E net, I can also write", 
    "down E free times 1 minus b.", 
    "And that 1 minus b now we call 1 over kappa.", 
    "I call it 1 over kappa.", 
    "Our book calls it 1 over k.", 
    "But I'm so used to kappa that I decided to", 
    "still hold onto kappa.", 
    "And that k, or that kappa, whichever you want to call it,", 
    "is called the dielectric constant.", 
    "It's a dimensionless number.", 
    "And so I can write down now, in general, that E--", 
    "and I drop the word \"net\" now.", 
    "From now on, whenever I write E throughout this lecture,", 
    "it's always the net electric field.", 
    "Takes both into account.", 
    "So you can write down now that E equals the free electric", 
    "field divided by kappa because 1 minus b is 1 over kappa.", 
    "And so you see in this experiment that I did in my", 
    "head, first bringing charge on the plate, a certain potential", 
    "difference, removing the power supply, shoving in the", 
    "dielectric, that the E field will go down", 
    "by a factor of kappa.", 
    "Kappa for glass is about 5.", 
    "That would be a major reduction.", 
    "I will show you that later.", 
    "If the electric field goes down, in this particular", 
    "experiment, it is clear that the potential difference", 
    "between the plates will also go down because the potential", 
    "difference between the plates, V, is always the electric", 
    "field between the plates times d.", 
    "And so, if this one goes down by a factor of kappa, if I", 
    "just shove in the dielectric not changing d, then, of", 
    "course, the potential between the plates is also going down.", 
    "None of this is so intuitive, but I will", 
    "demonstrate that later.", 
    "The question now arises--", 
    "does Gauss' Law still hold?", 
    "And the answer is yes, of course, Gauss'", 
    "Law will still hold.", 
    "Gauss' Law tells me that the closed surface integral of E", 
    "dot dA is 1 over epsilon times the sum of all the charges", 
    "inside my box.", 
    "All the charges, the net charges, that must take into", 
    "account both the induced charge as", 
    "well as the free charge.", 
    "And so let me write down here net to remind you of that.", 
    "But Q net is of course, Q free plus Q induced.", 
    "And I want to remind you that this is", 
    "minus and this is plus.", 
    "The free charge, positive there, is plus.", 
    "And at that same plate, if you have your Gaussian surface at", 
    "the top, you have the negative charged Q induced.", 
    "And so, therefore, Gauss' Law simply means that you have to", 
    "take both into account.", 
    "And so, therefore, you can write down 1 over epsilon 0", 
    "times the sum of Q free, but now you have to make sure that", 
    "you take the induced charge into account.", 
    "And, therefore, you divide the whole thing by kappa.", 
    "Then you have automatically taken the", 
    "induced charge into account.", 
    "So you can amend Gauss' Law very easily by", 
    "this factor of kappa.", 
    "The dielectric constant is dimensionless,", 
    "as I mentioned already.", 
    "It is 1 in vacuum, by definition.", 
    "1 atmosphere gases typically have dielectric constants just", 
    "a hair larger than 1.", 
    "We will, most of the time, assume that it is 1.", 
    "Plastic has a dielectric constant of 3.", 
    "And glass, which is an extremely good insulator, has", 
    "a dielectric constant of 5.", 
    "If you have an external field that can induce dipoles in", 
    "molecules--", 
    "well, there are substances, however, which themselves are", 
    "already dipoles, even in the absence of an electric field.", 
    "If you apply now an external field, these dipoles will", 
    "start to align along the electric field.", 
    "We did an experiment once with some grass seeds.", 
    "Perhaps you remember that.", 
    "And as they align in the direction of the electric", 
    "field, they will strengthen the induced electric field.", 
    "On the other hand, because of the temperature of the", 
    "substance, these dipoles, these molecules which are now", 
    "dipoles by themselves, through chaotic", 
    "motion will try to disalign.", 
    "Temperature is trying to disalign them.", 
    "So it is going to be a competition, on the one hand,", 
    "between the electric field which tries to align them and", 
    "the temperature which tries to disalign them.", 
    "But if the electric field is strong, you can get a", 
    "substantial amount of alignment.", 
    "Permanent dipoles, as a rule, are way stronger than any", 
    "dipole that you can induce by ordinary means in a", 
    "laboratory.", 
    "And so the substances which are natural dipoles, they have", 
    "a much higher value for kappa, a much higher dielectric", 
    "constant, than the substances that I just discussed, which", 
    "themselves do not have dipoles.", 
    "Water is an example, extremely good example.", 
    "The electrons spend a little bit more time near the oxygen", 
    "than near the hydrogen.", 
    "And water has a dielectric constant of 80.", 
    "That's enormous.", 
    "And if you go down to lower temperature-- if you take ice", 
    "of minus 40 degrees--", 
    "it is even higher.", 
    "Then the dielectric constant is 100.", 
    "I'm now going to massage you through four demonstrations,", 
    "four experiments.", 
    "One of them you have already seen.", 
    "And try to follow them as closely as you can because if", 
    "you miss one small step, then you miss, perhaps, a lot.", 
    "I have two parallel plates which are on this table, as", 
    "you have seen last time.", 
    "And I have here a current meter.", 
    "I put an A in there, that means amp meter.", 
    "And the plates have a certain separation, d.", 
    "I'm going to charge this capacitor up by connecting", 
    "these ends to a power supply.", 
    "And I'm going to connect them to 1,500 volts.", 
    "I'm already going to set my lights because that's where", 
    "you're going to see it very shortly.", 
    "I'm going to start off with a distance, d-- so this is going", 
    "to be my experiment one--", 
    "with a distance, d, of 1 millimeter.", 
    "And the voltage--", 
    "V always means the voltage, the potential difference", 
    "between the plates--", 
    "is going to be 1,500 volts.", 
    "Forgive me for the two V's.", 
    "I can't help that.", 
    "This means here the potential difference, and this is the", 
    "unit in volts.", 
    "Once I have charged them, I disconnect--", 
    "this is very important--", 
    "I disconnect the power supply, for which I write PS.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "So the charge is now trapped.", 
    "As I charge it, as you saw last time, you will see that", 
    "the amp meter shows a short surge of current because as I", 
    "put a charge on the plates, the charge has to go from the", 
    "power supply to the plates.", 
    "And you will see a short surge of current, which will make", 
    "the hand of the amp meter, as you will see on the wall", 
    "there, go to the right side just briefly", 
    "and then come back.", 
    "This indicates that you're charging the plates.", 
    "And now I'm going to open up the gap.", 
    "So this is my initial condition.", 
    "There's no dielectric.", 
    "And now I'm going to go d to seven millimeters.", 
    "And this is what I did last time.", 
    "The reason why I do it again is because I need this for my", 
    "next demonstration."
