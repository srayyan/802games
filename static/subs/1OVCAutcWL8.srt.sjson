    "WALTER LEWIN: Yesterday we had 225 motors.", 
    "And six of those motors went faster than 2000 RPM, which is", 
    "a reasonable accomplishment.", 
    "And the elite is here.", 
    "These are the elite.", 
    "The six highest.", 
    "The winner is Jung Eun Lee, I talked to her on the phone", 
    "last night.", 
    "If all goes well she is here.", 
    "Are you here?", 
    "Where are you?", 
    "There you are.", 
    "Why don't you come up so that I can", 
    "congratulate you in person.", 
    "I thought about the prize for a while.", 
    "And I decided to give you something that is not", 
    "particularly high tech, but come up here, give me a", 
    "European kiss, and another one.", 
    "In Europe we go three.", 
    "OK.", 
    "The prize that I have for you is a thermometer which goes", 
    "back to the days of Galileo Galilei.", 
    "Come here.", 
    "It was designed in the early part of the 17th century.", 
    "It doesn't require any knowledge of 8.02 to explain", 
    "how it works.", 
    "If anything, you need 8.01.", 
    "It's not a digital thermometer.", 
    "But it's accurate to about 1 degree centigrade.", 
    "And if you come here, you can tell, you look at these", 
    "floaters and the highest floater indicates the", 
    "temperature.", 
    "It's now 72 degrees here.", 
    "And I suggest that you brush up on your knowledge of 8.01", 
    "so that, perhaps, next week you can explain", 
    "to me how it works.", 
    "And of course, tell your grandchildren about it.", 
    "You may want to leave it here.", 
    "It's very fragile.", 
    "There's also some packaging material here so that you can", 
    "take it home without breaking it.", 
    "So congratulations once more.", 
    "And of course--", 
    "[APPLAUSE]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Terrific.", 
    "And you will join us for dinner on the 13th of April", 
    "with the other five winners.", 
    "Thank you, very much.", 
    "There are two other people who are very special, who I want", 
    "to mention.", 
    "And one is a person who is not enrolled in 8.02, but he did", 
    "extremely well.", 
    "And he was very generous, he was not competing.", 
    "His name is Daniel Wendel.", 
    "His motor when 4,900 RPM.", 
    "And then there was Tim Lo.", 
    "Is Tim Lo in the audience?", 
    "I hope he's going to be there at 11 o'clock.", 
    "Tim made a motor--", 
    "when I looked at it I said to myself, it will never run, but", 
    "it's so beautiful.", 
    "It was so artistic that we introduced a new prize, a", 
    "second prize for the most artistic motor.", 
    "And Tim Lo definitely is the one, by far the best, the most", 
    "beautiful, the most terrific artistic design.", 
    "And so for him I bought a book on modern art-- what else can", 
    "it be for someone who built such a beautiful motor?", 
    "It is here for those of you want to see it later.", 
    "It's very hard to display it on television,", 
    "because it's so delicate.", 
    "It's like a bird cage that he built, instead of having just", 
    "loops like that, it's a bird cage.", 
    "It's very nice.", 
    "The winning motor I have here.", 
    "And I'm going to show you the winning motor.", 
    "And I also want to teach you some physics by demonstrating", 
    "the winning motor to you, in a way that you may never have", 
    "thought of.", 
    "So this is the winning motor.", 
    "And when we start this motor, the ohmic resistance of the", 
    "current loop is extremely low.", 
    "So the moment you connect it with your power supply, a very", 
    "high current will run.", 
    "But the moment that the motor starts to rotate, you have a", 
    "continuous magnetic flux change in these loops.", 
    "And so now the system will fight itself.", 
    "And it'll immediately kill the current, which is another", 
    "striking example of Faraday's Law.", 
    "I will show you the current of this motor when I block the", 
    "rotor so that it cannot rotate.", 
    "It's about 1.6 amperes.", 
    "And you will see the moment that I run the motor that that", 
    "current plunges by a huge amount.", 
    "Striking example of Faraday's Law.", 
    "So I now have to first show you this current, so here you", 
    "see the 1 and 1/2 volts.", 
    "And on the right side you see the current.", 
    "There is no current flowing now because the loop is", 
    "hanging in such a way that it makes no", 
    "contact with the battery.", 
    "And I'm going to try to make it--", 
    "there it is.", 
    "Do you see the 1.6 amperes on the right?", 
    "The current is so high that due to the internal resistance", 
    "of the power supply, the voltage also plunges.", 
    "But you saw the 1.6, right?", 
    "Now I'm going to run the motor.", 
    "See, the motor is running now.", 
    "And now look at the current.", 
    "Current now, 40 milliamperes, 30 milliamperes, 50", 
    "milliamperes.", 
    "It's 40 times lower than when I blocked the rotor.", 
    "And so this is one of the reasons why when you have a", 
    "motor, whichever motor it is, it could be just a drill, you", 
    "try not to block it all of a sudden.", 
    "Because an enormous current will run and it can actually", 
    "damage the motors.", 
    "So you see here how the current goes down by a factor", 
    "of 40 between running and not running.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Electric fields can induce electric dipoles in materials.", 
    "And in case that the molecules, or the atoms", 
    "themselves, are permanent electric dipoles, an external", 
    "electric field will make an attempt to align them.", 
    "We've discussed that in great detail before when we", 
    "discussed dielectrics.", 
    "And the degree of success depends entirely on how strong", 
    "the external electric field is.", 
    "And on the temperature.", 
    "If the temperature is low, you have very little thermal", 
    "agitation, then it is easier to align those dipoles.", 
    "We have a similar situation with magnetic fields.", 
    "If I have an external magnetic field, this can induce in", 
    "material magnetic dipoles.", 
    "And it induces magnetic dipoles at the atomic scale.", 
    "Now in case that the atoms or the molecules themselves have", 
    "a permanent magnetic dipole moment, then this external", 
    "field will make an attempt to align these dipoles.", 
    "And the degree of success depends on the strength of the", 
    "external field.", 
    "And again, on the temperature.", 
    "The lower the temperature, the easier it is to align them.", 
    "So the material modifies the external field.", 
    "This external field, today I will often call", 
    "it the vacuum field.", 
    "So when you bring material into a vacuum", 
    "field, the field changes.", 
    "The field inside is different from the external field, from", 
    "the vacuum field.", 
    "I first want to remind you of our definition of a magnetic", 
    "dipole moment.", 
    "It is actually very simple how it is defined.", 
    "If I have a current--", 
    "a loop, it could be a rectangle, it doesn't have to", 
    "be a circle--", 
    "and if the current is running in this direction, seen from", 
    "below clockwise, and in this area is A, then the magnetic", 
    "dipole moment is simply the current times the area A.", 
    "But we define the vector A, according to the right-hand", 
    "corkscrew rule.", 
    "If I come from below clockwise then the vector A is", 
    "perpendicular to the surface, and is then pointing upwards.", 
    "And so the magnetic dipole moment for which we normally", 
    "write mu is then also pointing upwards.", 
    "And so this is a vector A which is this normal according", 
    "to the right-hand corkscrew.", 
    "And if I have N of these loops, then the magnetic", 
    "dipole moment will be N times larger.", 
    "Then they will support each other if they're all in the", 
    "same direction.", 
    "I first want to discuss with you diamagnetism, \"dia--", 
    "magnetism.\" All materials, when you expose them to an", 
    "external magnetic field, will to some degree oppose that", 
    "external field.", 
    "And they will generate on an atomic scale an EMF which is", 
    "opposing the external field.", 
    "Now you will say, yes, of course, Lenz's Law.", 
    "Wrong.", 
    "It has nothing to do with Lenz's Law.", 
    "It has nothing to do with the free electrons in conductors", 
    "which produce an eddy current when there is it changing", 
    "magnetic field.", 
    "I'm not talking about a changing magnetic field, I'm", 
    "talking about a permanent magnetic field.", 
    "So when I apply a permanent magnetic field in all the", 
    "materials, a magnetic dipole moment is induced to oppose", 
    "that field.", 
    "And there is no way that we can understand that with 8.02.", 
    "It can only be understood with quantum mechanics.", 
    "So we'll make no attempts to that, but we'll accept it.", 
    "And so the magnetic field inside the material is always", 
    "a little bit smaller then than the external field.", 
    "Because the dipoles will oppose the external field.", 
    "Now I will talk about paramagnetism, \"para--", 
    "magnetism.\" There are many substances whereby the atoms", 
    "and the molecules themselves have a magnetic dipole moment.", 
    "So the atoms themselves, or the molecules, you can think", 
    "of them as being little magnets."
