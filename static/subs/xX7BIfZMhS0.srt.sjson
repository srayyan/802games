    "PROFESSOR LEWIN: No one would ever call this joules per", 
    "coulomb, we call this volts.", 
    "Called after the great Volta, who did a lot", 
    "of research on this.", 
    "So we call this volts.", 
    "But it's the same as joules per coulomb.", 
    "If we have a very simple situation like we have here,", 
    "that we only have one charge, then this is the potential,", 
    "anywhere, any distance you want, from this charge.", 
    "If R goes up, if you're further away, the potential", 
    "will become lower.", 
    "If this Q is positive, the potential is everywhere in", 
    "space positive for a single charge.", 
    "If this Q is negative, everywhere in space, the", 
    "potential is negative.", 
    "Electrostatic potential can be negative.", 
    "The work that I do per unit charge coming from infinity", 
    "will be negative if that's a negative charge.", 
    "And the potential, when I'm infinitely far way, when this", 
    "R becomes infinitely large, is zero.", 
    "That's the way we define our zero.", 
    "So you can have positive potentials near positive", 
    "charge, negative potentials near negative charge.", 
    "And if you're very, very far away, then potential is zero.", 
    "Let's now turn to our Van de Graaff.", 
    "It's a hollow sphere, has a radius R, about 30", 
    "centimeters.", 
    "And I'm going to put on here +10 microcoulomb.", 
    "It will distribute itself uniformly.", 
    "We will discuss that next time in detail,", 
    "because it's a conductor.", 
    "We already discussed last lecture that the electric", 
    "field inside this sphere is zero, and that the electric", 
    "field outside is not zero.", 
    "But that we can think of all the charge being at this point", 
    "here, +10 microcoulomb, is all here, as long as we want to", 
    "know what the electric field outside is.", 
    "So you can forget the fact that it is a sphere.", 
    "And so now I want to know what the electric potential is at", 
    "any point in space.", 
    "I want to know what it is here, and I want to know what", 
    "it is here at point P, which is now a", 
    "distance R from the center.", 
    "And I want to know what it is here at a distance, little r,", 
    "from the center.", 
    "So let's first do the potential here.", 
    "The potential at point P is an integral", 
    "going from r to infinity.", 
    "If I take the electric force divided by my test charge Q", 
    "dot dr. But this is the electric field.", 
    "See it is force times distance is work, but it is work per", 
    "unit charge.", 
    "So I take my test charge out.", 
    "And so this is the integral in r to infinity, E dot dr.", 
    "And that's a very easy integral because we know what", 
    "E is, electric field.", 
    "We've done several times.", 
    "Follows immediately from Coulomb's law.", 
    "And so, when you calculate this integral, you get Q", 
    "divided by 4 pi epsilon zero r.", 
    "Which is no surprise, because we already had that from a", 
    "point charge.", 
    "So this is the situation if r, little r, is larger than", 
    "capital R. Precisely what we had before.", 
    "We can put in some numbers.", 
    "If you put in r equals R, which is 0.3 meters, and you", 
    "put in here the 10 microcoulombs.", 
    "And here the 30 centimeters, then you'll", 
    "find 300,000 volts.", 
    "So you get 3 times 10 to the 5 volts.", 
    "If you take r equals 60 centimeters, you double it--", 
    "if you double the distance, potential goes down by a", 
    "factor of 2, it's 1 over r, so it would be 150 kilovolts.", 
    "And if you go to 3 meters, then it is 10 times smaller,", 
    "then it is 30 kilovolts.", 
    "And if you go to infinity, which for all practical", 
    "purposes would be Lobby 7, if you go to Lobby 7, then the", 
    "potential, for all practical purposes, is about zero.", 
    "Because r is so large that there's no potential left.", 
    "So if I, Walter Lewin, march from infinity to this surface", 
    "of the Van de Graaff, and I put a charge Q in my pocket,", 
    "and I march to the Van de Graaff, by the time I reach", 
    "that point, I have done work.", 
    "I multiply the charge now back to the potential that gives it", 
    "work again, because potential was work per unit charge.", 
    "And so the work that I have done then is the charge that I", 
    "have in my pocket times the potential.", 
    "In this case, the potential of the Van de Graaff.", 
    "If I go all the way to this surface,", 
    "which is 300,000 volts.", 
    "If I were a strong man, and I would put 1 coulomb in my", 
    "pocket, that's a lot of charge.", 
    "Then I would have done 300,000 joules of work.", 
    "By just carrying the 1 coulomb from Lobby 7 to the Van de", 
    "Graaff, that's about the same work I have to do to climb up", 
    "the Empire State Building.", 
    "It's the famous mgh--", 
    "my mass times g times the height that I have to climb.", 
    "So I know how the electric potential goes with distance,", 
    "it's a 1 over r relationship now I have arrived", 
    "at the Van de Graaff.", 
    "I am at the surface with my test charge.", 
    "And now I go inside.", 
    "And I slosh around inside, I feel no force anymore.", 
    "There is no electric field inside.", 
    "So as I move around inside, I experience no force.", 
    "That means I do no work.", 
    "So that means that the", 
    "potential must remain constant.", 
    "So the absence of an electric field here implies that the", 
    "electric potential everywhere is exactly the same.", 
    "Inside is the same as on the sphere.", 
    "Because no further work is needed in marching around with", 
    "a test charge.", 
    "And so, for this special case, I could make a graph of the", 
    "electric potential versus r.", 
    "And this is then the radius of the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And that will be a constant all the way up to this point.", 
    "And then it would fall off as 1 over r here.", 
    "And for the numbers that we have chosen, the potential at", 
    "the maximum here would be 300,000 volts.", 
    "Just as when you look at maps, where you see contours of", 
    "equal height of mountains, which we call equal altitudes.", 
    "Here we have surfaces of equipotential.", 
    "And if you had a point charge, or if you had the Van de", 
    "Graaff, these surfaces would be concentric spheres.", 
    "The further out you go, if the charge is positive, the lower", 
    "the potential would be.", 
    "There would be nicely spherical surfaces.", 
    "Suppose now, we had more than one charge.", 
    "We had a +Q1 charge, and we had a", 
    "-Q2 charge, for instance.", 
    "And you're being asked now, what is the", 
    "potential at point P?", 
    "Well, now the electric potential at point P, VP, is", 
    "the potential that you would have measured if Q1 had been", 
    "there alone.", 
    "You have to add the potential that you would have seen if Q2", 
    "had been there alone.", 
    "Just adding work per unit charge for one with work per", 
    "unit charge of the other.", 
    "And if this is negative, then this quantity is negative, and", 
    "this is positive.", 
    "So when you have configurations of positive and", 
    "negative charges, then of course, depending upon where", 
    "you are in space, if you're close to the plus charge, the", 
    "potential is almost certainly positive.", 
    "Because the 1/r is huge.", 
    "If you're very close to the negative charge, again, the", 
    "1/r of this little charge will dominate, and so you get a", 
    "negative potential.", 
    "So you have surfaces of positive potential, you have", 
    "equipotential surfaces of negative potentials.", 
    "And so there are surfaces which have zero potential.", 
    "They're not always very easy to envision.", 
    "What I want to show you is some work that Maxwell himself", 
    "did in figuring out these equipotentials.", 
    "And so I have here a transparency of a publication", 
    "by Maxwell.", 
    "You see a charge.", 
    "Let's assume it is +4 and +1.", 
    "Could be -4 and -1, but let's assume they are plus.", 
    "And you see the green lines, which we've seen before, which", 
    "are the field lines.", 
    "Don't pay any attention to the green field lines now.", 
    "The red lines are equipotentials, and you have", 
    "to rotate them about the vertical because they are, of", 
    "course, surfaces.", 
    "This is three dimensional.", 
    "I have not drawn all the equipotential surfaces in red,", 
    "because they become too cluttered here.", 
    "But I've tried to put most of them in red.", 
    "Since this charge is positive and that charge is positive,", 
    "everywhere in space, no matter where you are, the potential", 
    "has to be positive.", 
    "There's not a single point where it could be negative.", 
    "If you are very far away from the +4 and the +1, then you", 
    "expect that the equipotential surfaces are spheres, because", 
    "it's almost as if you were looking at a +5 charge.", 
    "So it doesn't surprise you that when you go far out that", 
    "you ultimately get spherical shapes.", 
    "When you are very close to the +4, they are perfect spheres.", 
    "When you're very close to the +1, they are perfect spheres.", 
    "But then when you're sort of in between, neither close to", 
    "the +4 nor to the +1, they have this very funny shape.", 
    "It reminds me the shape of this balloon a little bit.", 
    "Sort of like this.", 
    "You see?", 
    "And there's one surface which is most unusual, equipotential", 
    "surface, which here has a point where the", 
    "electric field is 0."
