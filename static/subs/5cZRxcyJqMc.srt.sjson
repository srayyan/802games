    "PROFESSOR: The first thing that you notice is that there is a phase lag", 
    "between the current and the driving voltage.", 
    "If phi--", 
    "as you're going to see--", 
    "is 90 degrees, then the current is delayed by one quarter of a cycle.", 
    "Well, the fact that the current comes later than the driving voltage perhaps", 
    "is intuitive, because the self-inductance is fighting the change", 
    "in the current.", 
    "So it's perhaps not so surprising that there's going to be a delayed--", 
    "the current comes a little later.", 
    "If you look at this equation here, then what you have in front of the", 
    "cosine term is obviously the maximum possible current.", 
    "Because the Cosine term is just oscillating between", 
    "plus 1 and minus 1.", 
    "And so this here is the maximum current that you can ever get.", 
    "In one full cycle, you get positive and you get negative that value.", 
    "And notice here the role of omega L really plays a role of a resistance.", 
    "And in fact, the dimension of omega L is Ohms.", 
    "It really plays the role of a resistance.", 
    "And if omega is very high, then the resistance here becomes very high, and", 
    "so your current becomes very low.", 
    "Well, that's intuitively pleasing, because if omega is high, then the", 
    "changes, the dI/dt's are very, very high.", 
    "And therefore, if they are very fast changes, the induced EMF", 
    "is going to be high.", 
    "And so the current will be low.", 
    "Also if L is very high, then the system also is capable of fighting", 
    "back very hard.", 
    "And so it puts up a large resistance.", 
    "So it's also pleasing that you see the L there downstairs.", 
    "If omega is very low-- in your mind, you can make omega 0.", 
    "You don't even have alternating current when omega is 0.", 
    "Then you have DC, which is direct current.", 
    "So when you make omega 0, you simply get I is V0 divided by R.", 
    "That's Ohm's Law.", 
    "That's obvious that you get that.", 
    "Let's now look at the phase angle.", 
    "The tangent of phi is omega L divided by R. If the self-inductance is very", 
    "large, then the system has a strong ability to fight back.", 
    "So it can delay that current by a large amount.", 
    "And the same is true if omega is high.", 
    "If omega is high, then the time changes occur on a", 
    "very small time scale.", 
    "And so the system can fight back.", 
    "Because remember, you always have to the EMF proportional to dI/dt.", 
    "And so it's also pleasing to see that omega and L are upstairs here.", 
    "For either one being large, it can fight back and it can", 
    "hold back the current.", 
    "I have worked out a situation whereby we have an LR circuit.", 
    "This is on the web.", 
    "You can download that, so you don't have to copy it.", 
    "And the reason why I have these values is because it's directly coupled to a", 
    "demonstration that I will do shortly.", 
    "You see an L in series with an R. The L is 10 milli Henry", 
    "And the R is 10 ohms.", 
    "And let the V0 be 10 volts.", 
    "And here you see three frequencies--", 
    "100 Hz, 1,000 and 10,000 Hz.", 
    "And here you see the values for omega.", 
    "You have to multiply Hz with 2 pi.", 
    "And look now at omega L. At low frequency, 100 Hz,", 
    "omega L is 6.3 ohms.", 
    "Compare that with the 10 ohms, and it is maybe comparable.", 
    "But now look for it into the 10,000 Hz.", 
    "The omega L is huge.", 
    "It's 630 ohms.", 
    "So it entirely determines, so to speak, the resistance of that circuit.", 
    "And so the current that is going to run-- at least this is the maximum", 
    "current, is this value, which we also saw here on the blackboard.", 
    "That current at high frequency is enormously reduced.", 
    "It's 50 times lower than this current at low frequency, even though they", 
    "have the same value for V0.", 
    "And then you see here the phase angles.", 
    "And the reason why you have these values is that I can make", 
    "you listen to this.", 
    "I can make you hear this.", 
    "Because your hearing is very good at 100 Hz.", 
    "And since all of you are young, you can probably hear even 10,000 Hz.", 
    "Maybe some of you can even hear 20 k Hz.", 
    "When you get older, you lose your high frequencies.", 
    "In fact, my frequency cut-off is somewhere near 4,000 Hz.", 
    "I'm going to make you listen to music.", 
    "And there will be violins, which produce probably 3,000,", 
    "4,000, 5,000 Hz.", 
    "And then I will turn on, all of a sudden, the 10 milli H. So first, I'll", 
    "make you listen to music whereby there is no 10 mH in there.", 
    "And then I will turn on the 10 mH.", 
    "And what you will hear is that the violins disappear.", 
    "Because the current reduction is now huge on the high frequency, but it's", 
    "very little on the low frequency.", 
    "And that's the idea of what a self-inductor can do for you.", 
    "So if you listen to this--", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "--there's no self-inductor in now.", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "There's no music either.", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "OK.", 
    "OK.", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "It's a different music.", 
    "No self-inductor.", 
    "Self-inductor.", 
    "The high frequencies are gone.", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "No self-inductor.", 
    "You can turn a violin concerto into a cello concerto.", 
    "You just cut the violins out.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I cannot make you listen to the phase shift, not even in the case of the 90", 
    "degree phase shift.", 
    "And that is quite obvious.", 
    "Because what does it mean that there is a 90 degree phase shift?", 
    "It means that during one cycle of 10,000 Hz--", 
    "which takes only 1/10,000 of a second--", 
    "that the high frequencies are shifted by only 25 microseconds.", 
    "And there's no way that your ears can hear that.", 
    "The fact that the composer wanted those violins to come in 25", 
    "microseconds earlier than they do, of course, is something you cannot hear.", 
    "So I cannot make you listen to the phase shift.", 
    "But for the phase shift, I have something else.", 
    "And for that something else, I'm going to return to my last lecture, in which", 
    "we levitated a women--", 
    "magnetic levitation.", 
    "And so I'm going to return to that idea and grind a little deeper than we", 
    "did when I gave that lecture just before spring break.", 
    "I had a coil.", 
    "And I was driving that coil with 60 Hz AC.", 
    "And let's assume that, looking from above, the current was running in", 
    "clockwise direction, which is exactly what I assumed when I", 
    "discuss this with you.", 
    "And so the magnetic field is coming down like this, this magnetic dipole", 
    "field produce by this coil.", 
    "And then we had here--", 
    "we had a conducting plate under there.", 
    "And I said to you, when this magnetic field is increasing in strength, then", 
    "there's going to be an induced EMF here which tries", 
    "to oppose that change.", 
    "And so the induced current that is going to run, which we call eddy", 
    "current, is going to run in this direction.", 
    "If this is clockwise, this current is going to be counterclockwise, so it's", 
    "going to produce a magnetic field in this direction.", 
    "It opposes the change of the increasing magnetic field--", 
    "Lenz's Law.", 
    "And since the two currents are in opposite direction, the", 
    "two repel each other.", 
    "And you bought off on that.", 
    "And we levitated a woman.", 
    "However, no one asked me the question, what happens a little later in time", 
    "when the magnetic field is still in the downward direction, but it is", 
    "decreasing?", 
    "Since it is an AC current, there comes a time that the magnetic field will be", 
    "decreasing in time.", 
    "Now the EMF here must flip over, because Lenz says, sorry, we don't", 
    "like the decrease.", 
    "The moment that the EMF flips over, this current will flip over.", 
    "The two currents are now in the same direction and they will", 
    "attract each other.", 
    "And so there goes your magnetic levitation--", 
    "half the time, attraction, half the time, they repel each other.", 
    "But yet, we did levitate the woman.", 
    "And the secret lies in the self-inductance.", 
    "This current that runs here runs over a path-- which is very difficult, to", 
    "me to anticipate--", 
    "which has a certain resistance R. And it has a certain self-inductance L.", 
    "We know what omega is.", 
    "That's about 360.", 
    "And so we do get, in this conductor, we get the induced current here is", 
    "delayed by a phase angle given by this equation.", 
    "It's delayed over the induced EMF.", 
    "The EMF immediately coupled to what this couple is doing, but the induced", 
    "current is delayed.", 
    "And I have something that will allow you to see that perhaps", 
    "in even more detail.", 
    "This red curve is the current for the coil that you see there above.", 
    "And when the current is above the black line, it's clockwise.", 
    "And when it is below the black line, it's counter-clockwise.", 
    "The vertical scales are arbitrary.", 
    "The green curve is the EMF which is induced in the conductor.", 
    "Notice when the magnetic field increases, when the current goes up in", 
    "the coil, that the EMF in the conductor is in such a direction that", 
    "it opposes the change of that magnetic field.", 
    "But now when the magnetic field goes down, when the current in the coil", 
    "goes down, immediately, the EMF flips over, which is what I just", 
    "mentioned to you.", 
    "And therefore, if the induced current and the induced EMF were in phase with", 
    "each other, half the time, you would have attraction, and half the time,", 
    "you would have that the two repel each other.", 
    "And that won't give you magnetic levitation.", 
    "Here, what you see is a blue curve which represents the induced current.", 
    "I call it the eddy current.", 
    "If there is no phase shift between the induced EMF and the induced current,", 
    "notice that half the time, the blue curve and the red curve are in", 
    "opposite directions.", 
    "When they're in opposite directions, they repel each other.", 
    "When they're in the same direction, they attract each other.", 
    "But now if I have a phase delay so that the induced current comes later", 
    "than the EMF--", 
    "and I'm going to do something dramatic.", 
    "I'm going to shift it by 90 degrees, so the current is now 90 degrees", 
    "delayed relative to the induced EMF.--", 
    "look now that the red curve and the blue curve are always in opposite", 
    "directions.", 
    "And so now there's 100% of the time a repelling force.", 
    "The coil repels the conductor and the conductor repels the coil.", 
    "Now in the case when we levitated the woman, I'm sure that the phase delay", 
    "was not 90 degrees.", 
    "But maybe it was only 30 or 40 degrees.", 
    "But the net result is--", 
    "here the shift is not 90 degrees.", 
    "The net result is you get, on average, a repelling force.", 
    "And so the secret of the repelling force in the case of the levitation of", 
    "this coil, and therefore, of the levitation of the woman, lies in the", 
    "fact that there is a finite self-inductance in here."
