    "Let's get this down, and I'll bring the lights back up and", 
    "we go back to normal.", 
    "I have here a 100 microfarad capacitor.", 
    "It's a dangerous baby.", 
    "And we can charge that up to 3,000 volts.", 
    "And when we do that, we get 3/10 of a coulomb of charge on", 
    "that capacitor.", 
    "I'll give you some numbers.", 
    "So it is 100 microfarad.", 
    "I'm going to put a potential difference", 
    "over it of 3,000 volts.", 
    "That gives it a charge, Q, of 0.3 coulomb.", 
    "And that means that 1/2 CV squared, which is the energy", 
    "that is stored then in the capacitor, is 450 joules.", 
    "And this will take 15 minutes.", 
    "And so I'm going to charge it now because at the end of the", 
    "lecture I need a charge capacitor for a demonstration.", 
    "And so I can show you there the potential difference over", 
    "the capacitor which will slowly change.", 
    "And we'll keep an eye on it during the lecture.", 
    "And then by the time it's fully charged, we will have", 
    "reached the end of the lecture and then we can continue.", 
    "So here is then this monster, the 100 microfarad.", 
    "I call it a monster because the amount of energy that you", 
    "can pump in there is frightening.", 
    "It's 450 joules.", 
    "And my power supply is here.", 
    "That will deliver, comfortably, 3,000 volts.", 
    "In fact, this is the voltage of the power supply.", 
    "This is about 3,800 volts.", 
    "And so, now the idea is that I'm going", 
    "to charge this capacitor.", 
    "Always have to be very slow and careful that I don't make", 
    "mistakes because this is really a device that could be", 
    "lethal if you are not careful.", 
    "So I think we're OK.", 
    "The moment that I'm going to charge this capacitor, the", 
    "reading there will show you the potential difference over", 
    "these plates.", 
    "And it'll take a long time for that to go up to 3,000 volts.", 
    "And so I think I'm ready to go.", 
    "And I'm going to charge it now.", 
    "So you see now that the potential difference over the", 
    "plates is very low.", 
    "It's near 0.", 
    "But if you wait just a few seconds, you will see, very", 
    "slowly, that it is charging up.", 
    "And 15 minutes from now, we will be very close to the", 
    "3,000 volt mark and then we will return to this.", 
    "So we'll leave it on just for now while it is charging.", 
    "The idea of a photo flash is that you charge up a capacitor", 
    "and that you discharge it over a light source.", 
    "So the idea being that you have a capacitor--", 
    "let me erase some of this--", 
    "and then we charge the capacitor up, put a certain", 
    "amount of energy in there.", 
    "And then we dump all that energy in a bulb.", 
    "So here is a capacitor.", 
    "We're going to charge it up.", 
    "We have a switch here, and here is a light bulb.", 
    "And when we throw the switch, then all the energy will be", 
    "going to the light bulb.", 
    "If this is positively charged and this is negatively", 
    "charged, a current will start to flow and you will see a", 
    "flash of light.", 
    "I have here a capacitance of 1,000 microfarad, so C equals", 
    "1,000 microfarad.", 
    "I'm going to put a potential difference over that capacitor", 
    "of 100 volts, which then gives me a energy of 1/2 CV squared", 
    "which is 5 joules.", 
    "In fact, this is not just one capacitor, but these are 12", 
    "capacitors which I hooked up in such a way that the 12", 
    "capacitors of 80 microfarad each are a combined capacitor", 
    "of 1,000 microfarads.", 
    "And so I'm going to charge it up, and then I'm going to", 
    "discharge the capacitor through the light.", 
    "And then you will be able to see some lights, perhaps,", 
    "depending upon how much energy we dump through there.", 
    "So concentrate now on this light bulb.", 
    "The 100 volts, you should see here.", 
    "Do you see it?", 
    "So it's set at 100 volts now, and I'm now", 
    "going to charge it.", 
    "And the moment that I charge, you will see the voltage over", 
    "the capacitor.", 
    "And so it takes a while for it to charge up, so it goes way", 
    "down to 0 and then slowly comes back to 100.", 
    "It may take 5 or 10 seconds.", 
    "So if you're ready, then there we go.", 
    "Took only five or six seconds.", 
    "And so now we have 100 volts.", 
    "So we have 5 joules stored in there.", 
    "And I'm going to discharge that now over this light bulb.", 
    "If you're ready--", 
    "3, 2, 1, 0.", 
    "A little bit of light.", 
    "I can tell that you're disappointed.", 
    "It's not very exciting.", 
    "It's not really my style, is it?", 
    "Well, what we can do, we can increase the", 
    "voltage a little bit.", 
    "We could go to 250 volts, in which case, since it goes with", 
    "V squared, we would have 6 times more energy.", 
    "So then we'd have 30 joules.", 
    "So let's see whether that's a little bit more exciting.", 
    "So now I have to jack up the voltage to 250 volts.", 
    "Now you see the power supply again.", 
    "250 volts, we're getting there.", 
    "We don't have--", 
    "oh boy, am I lucky, on the button.", 
    "So 250 volts.", 
    "And now I can charge up again.", 
    "It will take a little longer.", 
    "So you'll see the voltage over the capacitor--", 
    "140, 170, 200, 250.", 
    "There we are.", 
    "And now we can see whether we get a little bit more light.", 
    "So you go from 5 joules now to 30 joules.", 
    "3, 2, 1, 0.", 
    "Now we're getting somewhere.", 
    "Now you really see how a photo flash works.", 
    "Now we all, of course, have destructive instincts.", 
    "And so you wonder--", 
    "right?", 
    "You're thinking the same thing that I do.", 
    "Shall we try 340 volts and see whether", 
    "the bulb maybe explodes?", 
    "I don't know how high this voltage supply can go.", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "Let's go all the way.", 
    "337 volts.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So that would mean that we have 50 joules, roughly.", 
    "It goes as the voltage squared.", 
    "Well, let's charge again.", 
    "We're charging now.", 
    "200, 280, 300.", 
    "There we go, 337 volts.", 
    "Now let's see.", 
    "Ah, we did it.", 
    "It broke.", 
    "I have a photo flash.", 
    "And I have the photo flash here.", 
    "And this photo flash has a capacitor of about 5,000", 
    "microfarads, a real biggie.", 
    "And we can charge that up to a potential difference of 100", 
    "volts, even though the batteries in", 
    "there are only 6 volts.", 
    "And there's a circuit in there, we'll learn about that", 
    "later, which converts the 6 volts to 100 volts.", 
    "And so we can charge up this capacitor to 100 volts.", 
    "And that means that the 1/2 CV squared, the energy stored", 
    "then in that capacitor, will be 25 joules.", 
    "And I can dump that energy over the light bulb, and then", 
    "we see a bright flash of light because this discharge can", 
    "occur in something like only a millisecond.", 
    "So you get a tremendous amount of light only for that", 
    "millisecond.", 
    "And I want to demonstrate that to you.", 
    "And the only way I can demonstrate that to you is by", 
    "aiming this flashlight at you.", 
    "I don't want to damage your eyes, so", 
    "I warn you in advance.", 
    "So I am charging up now my capacitor,", 
    "it will take a while.", 
    "And I'm going to take your picture.", 
    "I might as well.", 
    "But it's going to be very dark in the back there, and so I've", 
    "asked Marcos and Bill to also have some flash lights which", 
    "go off at the same time that my flash light goes off.", 
    "Now you may say, well, how can you do that?", 
    "Because if this flash only lasts a millisecond, how can", 
    "you synchronize that?", 
    "Well, the way that's done is that those flash lights are", 
    "waiting for my light signal to reach them and that goes with", 
    "the speed of light.", 
    "Takes way less than a millisecond to get there.", 
    "And they go at the same time that they receive my light", 
    "flash, and so we call them flash assists.", 
    "And so let's see whether we can do this.", 
    "I have a green light here.", 
    "That means I can take my picture.", 
    "Oh, you don't have to comb your hair, but", 
    "you're looking good.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Let me focus because that's important.", 
    "So make sure you see the flash.", 
    "You're ready for this?", 
    "Did you see the flash?", 
    "Did it flash?", 
    "Oh, it did.", 
    "You can say yes.", 
    "So did the light assist also flash?", 
    "OK.", 
    "But you haven't seen that yet, right, because you were", 
    "looking at them.", 
    "You really should have looked at me.", 
    "So why don't we take a picture--", 
    "Marcos, Bill--", 
    "aim the flash assist at the students here, and then we'll", 
    "try it again.", 
    "You ready?", 
    "OK.", 
    "Oh boy.", 
    "Why don't you say cheese for a change?", 
    "OK, look at me.", 
    "Oh boy, you're looking great.", 
    "You're out of focus.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: One person sleeping there.", 
    "Oh, we'll let him sleep.", 
    "That's OK.", 
    "Did that work?", 
    "Did you see the flash?", 
    "You did?", 
    "25 joules.", 
    "But those haven't seen it yet.", 
    "So Marcos, Bill, make sure that we go this way and give", 
    "them a chance to see this light flash.", 
    "So we get a little bit of assistance there, the light.", 
    "And let's see how this works.", 
    "Make sure that you see the flash.", 
    "Very good, you're going to see another 25 joules going", 
    "through this light bulb.", 
    "Very good.", 
    "Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.", 
    "Your hand is in front of your mouth, sir.", 
    "That's OK, thank you.", 
    "Very good.", 
    "Did you see the flash?", 
    "Did the assist go?", 
    "So that's the idea of photo flashes.", 
    "So you dump a lot of energy in a very short amount of time,", 
    "and you get a very bright flash.", 
    "Professor Edgerton at MIT became very famous for his", 
    "flash lights.", 
    "He invented flashes that can handle way more energy than", 
    "this flash, and they can dump that energy in less than 1", 
    "microsecond.", 
    "And so this opened up the road to high-speed photography.", 
    "And that made it possible to study the motion of objects on", 
    "time scales of microseconds and even shorter than that.", 
    "And I'd like to show you some of the pictures that were", 
    "taken with Doc Edgerton's flashes.", 
    "The first slide, you see a bullet coming from the right", 
    "going for a light bulb.", 
    "The exposure of this picture is only 1/3 of a microsecond,", 
    "during which the bullet probably moved only a 1/3 of a", 
    "millimeter.", 
    "So it looked like it's completely standing still.", 
    "And the bulb is heading for disaster, but it", 
    "doesn't know that yet.", 
    "The bullet moves, in 100 microseconds, about 8", 
    "centimeters."
