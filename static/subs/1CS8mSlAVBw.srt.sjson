    "Let's look at this point here.", 
    "That point, the current is going in the blackboard.", 
    "So here is that current, I.", 
    "And the magnetic field is like so.", 
    "The external magnetic field is like so.", 
    "So in what direction is the Lorentz force?", 
    "It's always in the direction I cross B. And I cross B is in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "That's the direction of the Lorentz force.", 
    "So right here there's a force on the loop in this direction.", 
    "So therefore right here there's a force on the loop in", 
    "this direction, on the current loop.", 
    "And so everywhere around this loop there's a force that is", 
    "pointing like this.", 
    "And so there clearly is a net force up.", 
    "And so this metal wants to go towards the magnet.", 
    "Another way of looking at it is that this current loop is", 
    "all by itself a little magnet, whereby the south pole is here", 
    "and the north pole is there.", 
    "Because this is the direction of the magnetic dipole moment.", 
    "And the north pole attracts the south pole.", 
    "That's another way of looking at it.", 
    "That's the reason why magnets attract each other, why north", 
    "and south poles attract each other, and why north and north", 
    "poles repel each other.", 
    "That's exactly the reason.", 
    "It is the current that is flowing.", 
    "It is the Lorentz force that causes the attraction or the", 
    "repelling force.", 
    "So paramagnetic material is attracted by a magnet.", 
    "Essential is that this field is non uniform.", 
    "And diamagnetic material, of course, will be repelled, will", 
    "be pushed away from the strong field.", 
    "Because in diamagnetic material, this current would", 
    "be running in the opposite direction, because it opposes", 
    "the external field.", 
    "Whereas paramagnetism supports it.", 
    "We have a third form.", 
    "And the third form of magnetism--", 
    "actually the most interesting--", 
    "is ferromagnetism.", 
    "In the case of ferromagnetism, we again have that the atoms", 
    "have themselves permanent dipole moments.", 
    "But now, for very mysterious reasons, which can only be", 
    "understood with quantum mechanics, there are domains,", 
    "which have the dimensions of about a tenth of a millimeter,", 
    "maybe three tenths of a millimeter, whereby the", 
    "dipoles are 100% aligned.", 
    "And these domains, which are in one direction, are", 
    "uniformly distributed throughout the", 
    "ferromagnetic material.", 
    "And so there may not be any net magnetic field.", 
    "If I have here-- if I try to make a", 
    "sketch of those domains--", 
    "something like this, then perhaps here all these dipoles", 
    "would all be 100% aligned in this direction.", 
    "But for instance here, they will all be", 
    "aligned in this direction.", 
    "And the number of atoms involved in such a domain is", 
    "typically 10 to the 17, maybe up to 10 to the 21 atoms.", 
    "So if now I apply an external field, these domains will be", 
    "forced to go in the direction of the magnetic field.", 
    "And of course, the degree of success depends on the", 
    "strength of the external field, the strength of the", 
    "vacuum field, and on the temperature.", 
    "The lower the temperature, the better it is.", 
    "Because then there's less thermal agitation, which of", 
    "course adds a certain randomness", 
    "to the whole process.", 
    "So when I apply an external field, the domains", 
    "as a whole can flip.", 
    "Inside ferromagnetic material, the magnetic field can be", 
    "thousands of times stronger than it is", 
    "in the vacuum field.", 
    "And we will see some examples of that today.", 
    "If you remove the external field, in the case of", 
    "paramagnetism, you have again complete chaos of the dipoles.", 
    "That's not necessarily the case was ferromagnetism.", 
    "Some of those domains may stay aligned in the direction that", 
    "the external field was forcing them.", 
    "If you very carefully remove that external field,", 
    "undoubtedly some domains will flip it back.", 
    "Because of the temperature, there's", 
    "always thermal agitation.", 
    "Some may remain oriented.", 
    "And therefore, the material, once it has been exposed to an", 
    "external magnetic field, may have", 
    "become permanently magnetic.", 
    "And the only way you can remove that permanent", 
    "magnetism could be to bang on it with a hammer.", 
    "And then of course these domains will then get very", 
    "nervous, and then they will randomize themselves.", 
    "Or you can heat them up, and then you could also undo the", 
    "orientation of the domains.", 
    "The domains themselves will remain.", 
    "But then they average out, not to produce any permanent", 
    "magnetic field.", 
    "So for the same reason that paramagnetism is pulled", 
    "towards the strong fields in case that we have a nonuniform", 
    "magnetic field, ferromagnetism, of course,", 
    "will also be pulled towards the strong field.", 
    "Except, in the case of ferromagnetism, the forces", 
    "with which ferromagnetic material is pulled towards a", 
    "magnet is way larger than in case of paramagnetic material.", 
    "If I take a paper clip--", 
    "you can do that at home--", 
    "you can hang a paper clip on the south pole of your magnet,", 
    "or the north pole of your magnet.", 
    "You all have gotten magnets in your motor kits, so you can", 
    "try that at home.", 
    "Take a paper clip, hang it on the magnet.", 
    "It doesn't matter on which side you hang it, because", 
    "ferromagnetic material is always pulled towards the", 
    "strong field.", 
    "If you hang a few of those paper clips on there, and you", 
    "very carefully and slowly remove them--", 
    "don't hit them with a hammer yet--", 
    "you may actually notice that after you remove them, that", 
    "the paper clips themselves have become magnetic.", 
    "You can actually try to hang them on each other, make a", 
    "little chain.", 
    "But drop them on the floor a few times, and that magnetism", 
    "will go away.", 
    "So what you have witnessed then is that some of those", 
    "domains remained aligned, due to your external field.", 
    "With paramagnetism, there's no way that you can hang", 
    "paramagnetic material, under most", 
    "circumstances, on a magnet.", 
    "There's one exception.", 
    "I will show you the exception later today.", 
    "And the reason is that the forces involved with", 
    "paramagnetic material, in general, only a few percent of", 
    "the weight of the material itself.", 
    "So if you take a piece of aluminum and you have a", 
    "magnet, aluminum will not stick to a magnet.", 
    "There is a force.", 
    "Aluminum will be attracted by the magnet, but the force is", 
    "way smaller than the weight of the aluminum.", 
    "So it won't be able to pick it up, unlike ferromagnetic", 
    "material, which you can pick up with a magnet.", 
    "So what I could demonstrate to you, for one thing, I could", 
    "take a bar magnet and show you that paper clips", 
    "are hanging on this.", 
    "I could also show you that aluminum is", 
    "not hanging on this.", 
    "But you won't find that very exciting.", 
    "And therefore I decided on a different demonstration,", 
    "whereby my goal is to show you that ferromagnetic material is", 
    "pulled with huge forces towards the strong magnetic", 
    "field, provided that I have a magnetic field which is", 
    "nonuniform.", 
    "And the way I will do that is with this piece of", 
    "ferromagnetic material.", 
    "And this piece of ferromagnetic material is", 
    "actually quite heavy.", 
    "And you're going to tell the class how heavy it is.", 
    "Be very careful.", 
    "What do you think?", 
    "Wow good for you.", 
    "Do it again.", 
    "It looks great.", 
    "It's 15kg of ferromagnetic material.", 
    "It is not a permanent magnet.", 
    "There may be a little bit of permanent", 
    "magnetism left, of course.", 
    "Once you have exposed it to an external field, yes, there may", 
    "be some permanent magnetism left.", 
    "So now I'm going to hold this.", 
    "Let's first make sure that nothing happens to Galileo's", 
    "thermometer.", 
    "So we're going to put this here.", 
    "See what the temperature is?", 
    "It's going up.", 
    "I Must be sweating.", 
    "It's 74 degrees now.", 
    "OK, so here is my magnet, producing about 320 Gauss.", 
    "But what counts is that the magnetic field is nonuniform", 
    "here and also here.", 
    "And so I'm going to turn on the magnet.", 
    "I believe I have to push a button here.", 
    "And the first thing I will do is now power this magnet.", 
    "So this is a solenoid.", 
    "I put my hand in here.", 
    "My hand is paramagnetic.", 
    "It's not being sucked in, really it isn't.", 
    "I feel nothing.", 
    "Forces--", 
    "I can't even feel anything.", 
    "But I'm not ferromagnetic, thank goodness.", 
    "Now this one.", 
    "15 kilograms, just sucked in like that.", 
    "And I'm very lucky that when it's overshoots here, that it", 
    "wants to go back.", 
    "Because it always wants to go to the strongest fields.", 
    "Doesn't matter whether you have it here or there.", 
    "The reason why that's lucky, is because if that were not", 
    "the case, this 15 kilogram bar would go like a bullet coming", 
    "out of here.", 
    "So the one thing you don't want to do when it goes in", 
    "there, you don't want to break the current.", 
    "Because then it would come out as a bullet.", 
    "And I'm not going to do that, believe me.", 
    "But I want to show you--", 
    "there it goes.", 
    "It's amazing ferromagnetic material.", 
    "So ferromagnetic material, there's enormous force if you", 
    "have a field that has a strong gradient, that's very", 
    "nonuniform, is sucked, pulled towards the strong side.", 
    "That's why it hangs on magnets.", 
    "That's the basic idea.", 
    "I have another demonstration.", 
    "Another demonstration is to make you sort of see, in a non", 
    "kosher way, magnetic domains.", 
    "But I'll tell you why it's non kosher.", 
    "I have here an array of eight by eight magnetic needles,", 
    "compass needles.", 
    "And you're going to see them there.", 
    "And I will change the situation so that you have", 
    "better light.", 
    "And when I have an external magnetic field, and I march", 
    "over here a little, and I just let it go and wait, you will", 
    "see areas whereby these magnetic needles point in the", 
    "same direction.", 
    "And you will see areas where they point", 
    "in a different direction.", 
    "We'll just give it some chance.", 
    "And so that may make you think that this is the way that", 
    "domains are formed in ferromagnetic material.", 
    "In fact, we have now a situation that almost all are", 
    "aligned in this direction.", 
    "And there's only a group here that is", 
    "pointing in this direction.", 
    "I can change that, of course, by changing", 
    "the magnetic field.", 
    "Why is this not really a kosher demonstration to", 
    "convince you that domains exist?", 
    "First of all, there's no thermal agitation, whereas in", 
    "ferromagnetic material there is thermal agitation.", 
    "Some may be oriented like this, and others like that.", 
    "Where here we only have two preferred directions.", 
    "You don't need quantum mechanics for that, simply a", 
    "matter of minimum energy considerations.", 
    "And so they either are pointed like this or they are", 
    "pointed like that.", 
    "So already that shows you that it's very different from", 
    "ferromagnetism.", 
    "But the reason why we show it to you is it still gives you", 
    "an interesting idea of the fact that you can have various", 
    "orientations, and that they come in groups, that the group", 
    "sticks together, and are not all in the same direction.", 
    "But, as I said, it is not really a good way to explain", 
    "to you why there are domains in ferromagnetic material.", 
    "Now you see again, you have some nicely aligned here, and", 
    "others are in very different direction here.", 
    "So the basic idea is there.", 
    "It's a nice demonstration.", 
    "But it shows you something that really is not related to", 
    "ferromagnetism.", 
    "The demonstration that is one of my favorites, one of my", 
    "absolute favorites, is one whereby I can make you listen", 
    "to the flip over of these domains.", 
    "I have ferromagnetic material inside a coil.", 
    "I have here a coil.", 
    "And I'm going to put", 
    "ferromagnetic material in here.", 
    "And I have here a loudspeaker, an amplifier as well.", 
    "And this is a loudspeaker.", 
    "Let's first assume there is no", 
    "ferromagnetic material in there.", 
    "That's the way I will start the demonstration.", 
    "And I approach this with a magnet.", 
    "And I go very fast.", 
    "What will happen?"
