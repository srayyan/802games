    "WALTER LEWIN: If you know the frequency of the", 
    "electromagnetic radiation, then the wavelength follows", 
    "immediately.", 
    "And so you see here a few examples that I've", 
    "calculated for you.", 
    "If you start out with a low frequency of 1,000 Hertz, you", 
    "get a wavelength of 300 kilometers,", 
    "radio waves, megaHertz.", 
    "Still talk about radio waves, which when you go up in", 
    "frequency, the wavelengths, of course,", 
    "get shorter and shorter.", 
    "We would call these radar waves, microwaves.", 
    "If you go to 10 to the 14, 10 to the 15 Hertz, you get into", 
    "the domain of infrared and visible light, and the", 
    "ultraviolet.", 
    "And if you go even higher, then you end up with x-rays,", 
    "and ultimately gamma rays.", 
    "All of these are members of the electromagnetic family--", 
    "electromagnetic waves.", 
    "This A with a little zero there stands for angstroms.", 
    "That means 10 to the -10 meters.", 
    "So a whole family of electromagnetic waves, and we", 
    "give them names so that we can talk about them without ever", 
    "mentioning the specific frequency or the wavelengths.", 
    "So given the fact that electromagnetic waves then", 
    "travel with 300,000 kilometers per second, one foot would", 
    "take one nanosecond.", 
    "26-100, 30 meters deep.", 
    "The light from me to Professor Bertozzi all the way at the", 
    "end would take about 0.1 microseconds.", 
    "One second, light, radio waves to the moon.", 
    "Eight minutes, it takes the light from the", 
    "sun to reach us.", 
    "The light from the nearest stars will take five years.", 
    "And the nearest large galaxy to the earth would take 2", 
    "million years for that light to reach us.", 
    "So when you look at that galaxy, then you see the", 
    "galaxy the way it was 2 million years ago.", 
    "In astronomy, we use as our meter stick a lightyear, which", 
    "is the distance that light travels in one year, which is", 
    "about 10 to the 16 meters.", 
    "If you study a galaxy which is at a distance of 10 billion", 
    "lightyears, you're looking at the universe the way it was 10", 
    "billion years ago.", 
    "So in astronomy, you can look back minutes, you can look", 
    "back years, you can look back millions of years, but you can", 
    "also look back in time billions of years.", 
    "Most forms of electromagnetic radiation--", 
    "certainly light and radio waves and radar--", 
    "can reflect off surfaces, at least to some degree.", 
    "It depends on the surface.", 
    "And this is the basis behind the distance determination.", 
    "When you send a radar pulse to an airplane or to a rainstorm,", 
    "some of that radiation comes back at you, and you know the", 
    "speed, and so that allows you to calculate the distance.", 
    "If the distance to the plane is d, and you send a brief", 
    "pulse, and it comes back-- we'll call it the echo--", 
    "and it takes a certain amount of time to come back, which", 
    "you can measure, then that signal has", 
    "traveled twice the distance.", 
    "So that is the speed of light times t.", 
    "This is what you measure, the distance in time from the", 
    "moment you send the signal until you get the reflection", 
    "back, and so you can calculate the distance.", 
    "The distance to the moon can be measured this way.", 
    "There are five corner reflectors on the moon.", 
    "Three were left there by the Americans, and two were left", 
    "by the Soviets, in the days when it was", 
    "still the Soviet Union.", 
    "An optical telescope from Earth can send", 
    "a very brief pulse--", 
    "laser pulse--", 
    "to these corner reflectors.", 
    "The length in time of this pulse is only 1/4 of a", 
    "nanosecond.", 
    "Just imagine-- light only travels seven centimeters in", 
    "one quarter of a nanosecond.", 
    "So the kind of wave that you get is really not very much of", 
    "a plane wave the way we envision it.", 
    "But in any case, this pulse goes to the moon, and then", 
    "some of it comes back, reflected off these corner", 
    "reflectors.", 
    "There are 2 times 10 to the 17 photons, roughly, in one of", 
    "these pulses, and only one comes back per 10 pulses.", 
    "So not much comes back.", 
    "But it's enough, if you integrate it, to get an", 
    "accurate distance determination between us and", 
    "the corner reflectors, and the accuracy is about 10", 
    "centimeters.", 
    "And the goal is really to get a handle on the precise orbit", 
    "of the moon.", 
    "I can show you these corner reflectors the way they were", 
    "built on earth, and then I will also show you an optical", 
    "observatory as it is sending out these quarter nanosecond", 
    "pulses of laser light to the moon.", 
    "So this is one of those corner reflectors.", 
    "They are designed in such a way that if light strikes it", 
    "in a certain direction, that it reflects the light in", 
    "exactly the same direction backwards 180 degrees.", 
    "Very clever design.", 
    "So the next slide will show you in Texas, McDonald", 
    "Observatory is sending here these short, brief pulses of", 
    "laser light to the moon.", 
    "And what you see here is simply some scattered light", 
    "off the dust in the Earth's atmosphere.", 
    "And then only a teeny weeny little bit of that comes back,", 
    "but that is enough to get the distance to the moon.", 
    "There are, on the moon--", 
    "that is enough of this slide, John--", 
    "there are, on the moon, several cameras.", 
    "They were left there by surveyors.", 
    "They are small cameras.", 
    "The lens, I think, is only two inches across.", 
    "And they keep an eye on the earth all the time.", 
    "Something that you may never have thought of.", 
    "If you were on the moon, and you look at the Earth, and the", 
    "Earth is there, say, that an hour from now, the Earth will", 
    "still be there.", 
    "And 10 hours from now, the Earth will still be there.", 
    "And 10 years from now, the Earth will still be there.", 
    "As seen from the moon, the Earth never moves.", 
    "Of course, it rotates about its axis.", 
    "You'll see that.", 
    "You will also see that certain parts of the Earth are at", 
    "night, and others are at day.", 
    "That's different.", 
    "But it's always in the same direction, so it's very easy", 
    "for these cameras to keep an eye on Earth, so to speak.", 
    "All you have to do is to aim them in one direction, and you", 
    "never have to change that direction.", 
    "Imagine that you and I were now on the moon, and we were", 
    "looking at the Earth.", 
    "And you, for instance, would see the Earth", 
    "as you see it here.", 
    "Here is North America, and this part of the Earth happens", 
    "to be daylight, and here, it's night.", 
    "And this is the moment that these cameras are going to", 
    "take a picture of the Earth.", 
    "So you expect to see a lot of light here, and you expect", 
    "this to be night.", 
    "Here is New York.", 
    "You may think that there's so much light coming from New", 
    "York that you may actually see New York-- that the picture", 
    "taken by these cameras actually may", 
    "show you New York.", 
    "Well, you won't, but you see something else,", 
    "which is very dramatic.", 
    "That's why I show this to you.", 
    "Because the picture that you're going to see next--", 
    "John, you can show it--", 
    "is at a time that two observatories on Earth were", 
    "both sending these laser pulses to the moon.", 
    "And here you see one in Arizona, and here you see one", 
    "in California.", 
    "But you don't see New York.", 
    "Isn't that amazing?", 
    "That you're on the moon, and you know there's", 
    "really life on Earth.", 
    "Someone is blinking at you--", 
    "well, you don't see the blinking, but", 
    "you see these lights.", 
    "Very dramatic shot.", 
    "Thanks, John, that's fine.", 
    "Radio waves can be generated by oscillating charges, and", 
    "we'll talk about that a great deal the next lecture.", 
    "So you run alternating current through", 
    "wires, called antennas--", 
    "this is an antenna--", 
    "and then you create electromagnetic waves.", 
    "And radio stations transmit at a well defined frequency.", 
    "For instance, WEEI transmits at 850 kiloHertz, wavelength", 
    "353 meters.", 
    "850 kiloHertz is an extremely high frequency.", 
    "How come I can hear things-- that I can hear music, and I", 
    "can hear someone speak?", 
    "Well, this signal--", 
    "we call this the carrier wave--", 
    "is being modulated.", 
    "The strength of that signal is modulated with the frequency", 
    "of audio sound.", 
    "We call that, therefore, amplitude modulation.", 
    "So for instance, if you looked at this signal as a function", 
    "of time, then this would be the audio", 
    "modulation of that signal.", 
    "But the transmitter would transmit 850 kiloHertz.", 
    "Here, the signal would be a little stronger, here a little", 
    "weaker, here a little stronger.", 
    "And if this were a 1,000 Hertz tone, then this would be one", 
    "millisecond.", 
    "At the receiving end, you tune your radio.", 
    "You change the capacitor somewhere in your radio--", 
    "you have an LRC circuit--", 
    "so that you are exactly on resonance at 850 kiloHertz,", 
    "and you're not on resonance at 840 kiloHertz, so you don't", 
    "hear other stations, but you really tune", 
    "in on that one station.", 
    "And you can receive the signal then.", 
    "And then you do some demodulation to only hear the", 
    "audio envelope, and you hear speech, and you hear music.", 
    "That's the idea.", 
    "Right here in 26-100 we have a transmitter, and I can", 
    "transmit sound at almost any frequency that we choose.", 
    "We've decided, in honor of you, to transmit a 1 kiloHertz", 
    "audio signal at 802 kiloHertz.", 
    "The 8.02 is in honor of you.", 
    "At 802 kiloHertz, there is no radio station, so this is a", 
    "nice thing to do.", 
    "We're not interfering with anyone.", 
    "We're going to transmit it here, and then we have a radio", 
    "here, and we're going to search for that", 
    "signal at 802 kiloHertz.", 
    "That's what we're going to do first, before we are going to", 
    "do some other things which are not so nice.", 
    "Now, Marcos is an expert in order to get the frequencies", 
    "right, so Marcos has promised to help me with this.", 
    "Very nice.", 
    "Oh, boy, you're already on--", 
    "we're already transmitting at 802 kiloHertz, and the station", 
    "is already receiving it--", 
    "the station meaning our radio.", 
    "Marcos, let me convince the students that indeed--", 
    "oh, you changed the frequency.", 
    "So he changed the audio signal.", 
    "So I want you to appreciate that we really are", 
    "transmitting from this antenna by unplugging it.", 
    "So now the radio doesn't see the electromagnetic waves at", 
    "802 kiloHertz.", 
    "So the radio is receiving now the radio", 
    "waves that we are producing.", 
    "Now we're going to do something that is not so nice.", 
    "We're going to change our frequency to 850 kiloHertz.", 
    "So now what are we going to do is jamming", 
    "the WEEI sports channel.", 
    "So you may hear our 1 kiloHertz tone, but you may", 
    "not hear what they are saying.", 
    "Can we first listen to WEEI before we do this nasty thing?", 
    "[MUFFLED VOICES ON RADIO]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: This is WEEI?", 
    "Now be a naughty boy.", 
    "We're doing something very illegal here.", 
    "In fact, we can do even worse.", 
    "I can be on the radio.", 
    "I'll have to turn off my microphone, because otherwise", 
    "you wouldn't know whether it comes from the radio or it", 
    "comes from my microphone.", 
    "Hello, hello?", 
    "Can you hear me?", 
    "This is Radio WHTL, it's a pirate station in the", 
    "Cambridge area.", 
    "We are now transmitting at 850 kiloHertz.", 
    "Our weekly programs will be on the latest", 
    "excitement in science.", 
    "Of course, we realize that this is illegal as hell, but", 
    "that's why you like it so much.", 
    "We start our first program next Monday at 10:00 AM, and", 
    "if you have any questions, feel free to contact the", 
    "physics department of Harvard University.", 
    "See you next Wednesday."
