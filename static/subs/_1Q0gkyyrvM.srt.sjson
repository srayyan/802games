    "WALTER LEWIN: Today, we're going to work", 
    "on a whole new concept.", 
    "And that is the concept of electric flux.", 
    "We've come a long way.", 
    "We started out with Coulomb's Law, then we got electric", 
    "field lines, and now we have electric flux.", 
    "Suppose I have an electric field just like so, and I", 
    "bring in that the electric field a surface, an open", 
    "surface like a handkerchief or a piece of paper.", 
    "And so here it is, something like that.", 
    "And I carve this surface up in very small surface elements,", 
    "each with size dA.", 
    "That's the area--", 
    "teeny-weeny little area.", 
    "And let this be the normal--", 
    "n roof--", 
    "the normal on that surface.", 
    "So now, the local electric fields, say at that location,", 
    "would be, for instance, this.", 
    "That's a vector E. The electric flux, d-phi that goes", 
    "through this little surface now is defined as the dot", 
    "product of E and the vector perpendicular to this element,", 
    "which has a magnitude dA.", 
    "Now, our book will always write for ndA simply dA.", 
    "So I will do that also, although I don't like it.", 
    "But I will follow the notation of the book.", 
    "So this vector dA is always perpendicular to that little", 
    "element dA, and it has the magnitude dA.", 
    "And so this, since it is a dot product, is the magnitude of E", 
    "times the area dA times the cosine of the angle between", 
    "these two vectors, theta.", 
    "And this is scalar.", 
    "The number can be larger than 0, smaller than 0,", 
    "and it can be 0.", 
    "And I can calculate the flux through the entire surface by", 
    "doing an integral over that whole surface.", 
    "The unit of flux follows immediately from the", 
    "definition.", 
    "That is newtons per coulomb.", 
    "So the units of this flux is newtons per coulomb times", 
    "square meters.", 
    "But no one ever thinks of it that way, just SI units.", 
    "I can give you some intuition for this flux by comparing it", 
    "first with an air flow.", 
    "These red arrows that you see there represent", 
    "the velocity of air.", 
    "And you see there a black rectangle - three times.", 
    "In the first case, notice that the normal to the surface of", 
    "that area is parallel to the velocity vector of the air.", 
    "And so, if you want to know now what the amount of air is,", 
    "in terms of cubic meters per second, going through this", 
    "rectangle, it would be v times A. It's very simple.", 
    "However, if you rotate this rectangle 90 degrees so that", 
    "the normal to that rectangle is perpendicular to the", 
    "velocity vector, nothing goes through that rectangle.", 
    "And so it's 0.", 
    "And so now the flux--", 
    "air flux-- is 0.", 
    "And if the angle is 60 degrees, then it is, of", 
    "course, v times A times the cosine of 60 degrees.", 
    "Now, think of these red vectors as electric fields.", 
    "So now, the electric flux going in the first case", 
    "through that surface is now simply E times A. In the", 
    "second case, it's 0.", 
    "And in the last case, it is EA times the", 
    "cosine of 60 degrees.", 
    "And so you can sometimes think of this as airflows.", 
    "We also saw that when we dealt with field lines.", 
    "That can come in, sometimes, very handy.", 
    "I now take a surface which is not open as this one is.", 
    "This is an open surface.", 
    "It's coming from both sides.", 
    "But now I choose one that is completely closed, like a", 
    "potato bag or a balloon.", 
    "I'll put this line in here to give you a feeling that there", 
    "is a completely closed surface.", 
    "So you can only get inside if you penetrate that surface", 
    "from the outside.", 
    "And so now, I can put up here and here these normals, dA.", 
    "And there's another normal here, maybe in", 
    "this direction, dA.", 
    "In this case, by convention, the normal to the surface,", 
    "locally to the surface, is always from the insides of the", 
    "surface to the outside world.", 
    "It's uniquely determined, because it's a closed surface.", 
    "Here, it was not uniquely determined.", 
    "I arbitrarily chose this one, but I could have flipped it", 
    "over 180 degrees.", 
    "Since it's an open surface, it's ill-defined.", 
    "Here, it's never ill-defined.", 
    "So the normal is always chosen.", 
    "Go from the inside to the outside.", 
    "And now, I can calculate the total flux going through this", 
    "closed surface.", 
    "Locally multiplying E with dA dot product over the whole", 
    "surface, out comes a certain number.", 
    "And that is now therefore the integral of E dot dA", 
    "integrated over that closed surface.", 
    "And since it is a closed surface, we put a circle here", 
    "to remind us that it is a closed integral.", 
    "And here, in this case, it is a closed surface.", 
    "And this, now, is the total flux through that surface.", 
    "It could be larger than 0.", 
    "It could be smaller than 0.", 
    "It's a scalar.", 
    "It's not a vector.", 
    "It could be equal to 0.", 
    "If it's equal to 0, then whatever flows in, if you", 
    "think of it as air, also flows out.", 
    "If more flows out then flows in, then it is positive.", 
    "If more flows in than flows out, it is negative.", 
    "So let's now calculate the flux for a very simple case", 
    "where I have a point charge.", 
    "So, here I have a point charge, and I'm going to put a", 
    "bag around this point charge.", 
    "And the bag is a sphere.", 
    "It is a sphere, and a sphere has radius capital R. And let", 
    "this be +Q, just for simplicity.", 
    "Well, I pick a small element, dA, here.", 
    "And that element dA is radially outwards.", 
    "This is the normal through that", 
    "surface, so that is radial.", 
    "The electric field at that point is also radial.", 
    "We have dealt with that before.", 
    "So dA and E, not only here but anywhere on the surface of", 
    "this sphere, are parallel.", 
    "So the cosine of the angle equals 1.", 
    "I can also introduce here the unit vector r roof, which is", 
    "the unit vector going from capital Q to that element", 
    "where I evaluate the teeny-weeny", 
    "little amount of flux.", 
    "So if now I want to know what the total flux is through this", 
    "sphere, that's very easy, because since this is a", 
    "sphere, the E vector in magnitude is everywhere the", 
    "same, because the radius is the same distance to this", 
    "charge, and dA and E are parallel.", 
    "So it's simply the surface--", 
    "4 pi R squared--", 
    "of that sphere times E. And so now, I have that the total", 
    "flux through that closed surface is simply 4 pi R", 
    "squared times E.", 
    "Well, what is E?", 
    "The electric field at this distance R equals Q divided by", 
    "4 pi epsilon 0 R squared times r roof.", 
    "That gives me the direction.", 
    "And so if I know that the flux is 4 pi R squared times E, I", 
    "put the 4 pi R squared here, I lose the 4 pi R squared, and I", 
    "find that E vector--", 
    "at least the magnitude of the electric field--", 
    "excuse me--", 
    "that the flux, phi-- that's what I want to calculate.", 
    "I multiply this by E equals Q divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "And this is independent of the distance R. And that's not so", 
    "surprising, because if you think of it as air flowing", 
    "out, then all the air has to come out somehow whether I", 
    "make the sphere this big or whether I make", 
    "the sphere this big.", 
    "So the flux, being independent, of the size of my", 
    "sphere, the flux is given by the charge, which is right", 
    "here at the center, divided by epsilon 0."
