    "Magnetic field outside the solenoid, as we discussed", 
    "earlier, is almost 0.", 
    "So there's only a magnetic field right here.", 
    "Keep that in mind in what follows.", 
    "And now we're going to put a wire around it with", 
    "an ammeter in there.", 
    "If the magnetic field comes out of the board and is", 
    "growing, is increasing, the current will flow in this", 
    "direction--", 
    "Lenz's law.", 
    "If it is decreasing, the current will go in the", 
    "opposite direction.", 
    "Now keep in mind that the magnetic flux through this", 
    "surface, that is my surface which I attach to this closed", 
    "loop, that that magnetic flux remains the same whether I", 
    "make the loop this big or whether I make the loop very", 
    "crooked, like so, because the magnetic flux is only confined", 
    "to the inner portion of the solenoid.", 
    "And that's not changing.", 
    "And so when I change the shape of this outer loop, you will", 
    "not see any change in the current.", 
    "I hope that doesn't confuse you.", 
    "I'm going to purposely change the size of the loop.", 
    "And so I'm going to do that now.", 
    "You're going to see there a very sensitive ammeter.", 
    "And you're going to see here this loop.", 
    "It's a big wire.", 
    "And I'm going to just put it over this solenoid.", 
    "Let me first make sure that my ammeter, which is extremely", 
    "sensitive, I can zero it.", 
    "It's sign sensitive.", 
    "If the current goes in one direction, you will see the", 
    "needle go in one direction.", 
    "If the current goes in the other direction, you will see", 
    "the change.", 
    "And so now I put this loop around here.", 
    "Crazy shape, this loop.", 
    "So it's around this solenoid once.", 
    "So the magnetic field is inside the solenoid.", 
    "And so think of a surface which is attached to this", 
    "crazy loop.", 
    "And now I'm going to turn the current on.", 
    "And only while the current is changing will there be a", 
    "changing magnetic flux.", 
    "Only during that portion will you see a current flow.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero.", 
    "I will break the current--", 
    "three, two, one, zero.", 
    "Went the other direction.", 
    "If I change the size of the loop, I'm making it now", 
    "different, much smaller.", 
    "It makes no difference, for reasons that I explained to", 
    "you, because the magnetic flux is not determined in this case", 
    "by the size of my loop, but is determined by the solenoid.", 
    "So if I do it again now with a very different", 
    "shape of the loop--", 
    "let me zero this again.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero.", 
    "No change.", 
    "Almost the same what you saw before.", 
    "Now comes something that may not be so intuitive to you.", 
    "I'm now going to wrap this wire three times around.", 
    "And so this outer loop, this outer conducting wire, is now", 
    "like this--", 
    "one, two, three.", 
    "Something like that.", 
    "Now I have to attach in my head a surface", 
    "to this closed loop.", 
    "My god, what does it look like?", 
    "What a ridiculous surface.", 
    "Well, that's your problem, not Faraday's problem.", 
    "How can you imagine that there is a surface", 
    "attached to this loop?", 
    "Well, take the whole thing and dip it in soap.", 
    "Take it out and see what you see.", 
    "The soap will attach everywhere on", 
    "the conducting loop.", 
    "And if this loop were like this, going up like a spiral", 
    "staircase, you're going to get a surface that", 
    "goes up like this.", 
    "But the magnetic fields go through all three of them.", 
    "Therefore changing magnetic flux will go three times", 
    "through the surface now.", 
    "And so Faraday says, fine that you're going to see three", 
    "times the EMF that you would see if there", 
    "were only one loop.", 
    "And if you go 1,000 times around, you get thousand times", 
    "the EMF of one loop.", 
    "Not so intuitive.", 
    "So I'm around now once.", 
    "I go around twice.", 
    "And I go around the third time.", 
    "I have three loops around it now.", 
    "I can zero that.", 
    "But that's not so important.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero--", 
    "you saw a much larger current.", 
    "It's about three times larger because the EMF", 
    "is three times larger.", 
    "I break the current.", 
    "You see it three times larger.", 
    "And this is the idea behind transformers.", 
    "You can get any EMF in that wire that you want to by", 
    "having many, many loops.", 
    "You can get it up to thousands of volts.", 
    "And that's not so intuitive.", 
    "So Faraday's law is very non-intuitive.", 
    "Kirchhoff's Rule was very intuitive.", 
    "Kirchhoff said when you go around a circuit, the closed", 
    "loop integral of E dot dl is always 0.", 
    "Not true if you have a changing magnetic flux.", 
    "If you have a changing magnetic flux, the electric", 
    "fields inside the conducting wires now become", 
    "non-conservative.", 
    "Kirchhoff's Rule only holds as long as the electric fields", 
    "are conservative.", 
    "If an electric field is conservative and you go from", 
    "point one to point two, the integral E dot dl is", 
    "independent of the path.", 
    "That's the potential difference between two points.", 
    "That's uniquely defined.", 
    "That's no longer the case.", 
    "If you go around once with this experiment, you get a", 
    "certain EMF.", 
    "You go three times around, you get a different value.", 
    "Your path is now different.", 
    "And that's very non-intuitive because you're dealing with", 
    "non-conservative fields, for which we", 
    "have very little feeling.", 
    "Now I'm going to blow your mind.", 
    "I'm going to make you see something", 
    "that you won't believe.", 
    "And so try to follow step by step leading up to this", 
    "unbelievable and very non-intuitive result.", 
    "I have here a battery.", 
    "And the battery has an EMF of 1 volt.", 
    "Here is a resistor, R1, which is 100 ohms.", 
    "And here is a resistor, R2, which is 900 ohms.", 
    "And I'm asking you, what is the current", 
    "that is flowing around?", 
    "And you will laugh at me.", 
    "You will say, that's almost an insult.", 
    "I wish you had given that problem at the first exam.", 
    "Because EMF equals the current that is going to run divided", 
    "by R1 plus R2.", 
    "Oh my goodness.", 
    "What did I do?", 
    "I forgot Ohm's law.", 
    "EMF equals IR, remember, not I over R. So R1 plus R2 should", 
    "go upstairs.", 
    "And everything that follows is correct.", 
    "So you don't have to worry about that.", 
    "This was just a big slip of the pen.", 
    "And so the current I is 10 to the minus 3 amperes, 1", 
    "milliampere.", 
    "big deal, easy.", 
    "Current is going to flow like this.", 
    "Fine.", 
    "Let's call this point D. And we'll call this point A.", 
    "And I asked you, what is the potential difference", 
    "between D and A?", 
    "You will be equally insulted.", 
    "VD minus VA.", 
    "You apply Ohm's law.", 
    "You say that's this current times R2.", 
    "Absolutely.", 
    "I times R2.", 
    "So that is plus 0.9 volts.", 
    "Now I say to you, well, suppose you had gone this way.", 
    "Then you would have said, well, I find the same thing,", 
    "of course, Kirchhoff's Rule.", 
    "So indeed, if you go VD minus VA, and you go this way, then", 
    "notice this battery at this point is one", 
    "volt above this point.", 
    "But in the resistor here, you have a voltage drop, according", 
    "to Ohm's law.", 
    "And the current times 100 ohms gives you a 1/10", 
    "voltage drop here.", 
    "So VD minus VA is the one volt from the battery", 
    "minus I times R1.", 
    "And that is plus 0.9 volts.", 
    "What a waste of time, that we did it twice and we found the", 
    "same result.", 
    "So I connect here a voltmeter.", 
    "The voltmeter is connected to point D and to point A. And I", 
    "ask you, what are you're going to see?", 
    "The answer is plus 0.9 volts.", 
    "And you will, provided that the plus side of the voltmeter", 
    "is connected here, and the minus side of", 
    "the voltmeter there.", 
    "Voltmeters are polarity sensitive.", 
    "This is fine.", 
    "Kirchhoff's Rule works.", 
    "The closed loop integral of E dot dl going from D", 
    "back to D is 0.", 
    "So far, so good.", 
    "Now hold on to your chairs.", 
    "I'm going to take the battery out.", 
    "Who needs the battery?", 
    "I'm going to replace the battery by a solenoid, which", 
    "you see right here.", 
    "And this solenoid, when I switch it on, is creating an", 
    "increasing magnetic field only here.", 
    "And let's assume that that increasing magnetic field is", 
    "coming out of the board, and that it is increasing.", 
    "Lenz's law will immediately tell you in what direction the", 
    "current is.", 
    "If this magnetic field is increasing toward you, the", 
    "current will be in this direction.", 
    "The magnetic flux change, dphi dt at a particular moment in", 
    "time happens to be 1 volt.", 
    "An amazing coincidence, isn't it?", 
    "EMF induced at the moment in time is 1 volt.", 
    "Now I ask you, what is the current?", 
    "You'll be surprised that I even have the", 
    "courage to ask you that.", 
    "Because Ohm's law holds.", 
    "The induced EMF is 1 volt.", 
    "And R1 plus R2 is still 1,000 ohms.", 
    "So 10 to the minus 3 amperes.", 
    "I really make a nuisance of myself when I say,", 
    "what is VD minus VA?", 
    "And you get annoyed at me.", 
    "And you say, look, the current I through R2, Ohm's law, V", 
    "equals IR plus 0.9 volts.", 
    "And then I say, but now suppose we go the other side?", 
    "And we want to know now what VD minus VA is.", 
    "And now it's not so simple, because there's no battery.", 
    "And so now when I go from D to A, I don't have this 1.", 
    "And therefore I now find minus 0.1 volts.", 
    "I find a totally different answer.", 
    "I attach a voltmeter here.", 
    "That voltmeter will show me plus 0.9 volts.", 
    "Now I attach a voltmeter here, the same one.", 
    "I flip it over.", 
    "It's connected between point D and point A. It will read", 
    "minus 0.1 volts.", 
    "This voltmeter which is connected between D and A", 
    "reads plus 0.9.", 
    "This voltmeter which is connected to D and", 
    "A reads minus 0.1.", 
    "The two values are different.", 
    "And I placed on the web a lecture supplement, which goes", 
    "through the derivation step by step, which will convince you", 
    "that indeed this is what is happening."
