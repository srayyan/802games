    "Now if I had chosen some other shape, not a sphere, but I", 
    "have dented it like this.", 
    "It's clear that the air that flows out would", 
    "be exactly the same.", 
    "And so, I don't have to take a sphere to find this result.", 
    "I could have taken any type of strange closed surface around", 
    "this point charge, and I would have found", 
    "exactly the same result.", 
    "And if I put more than one charge inside this potato bag", 
    "then clearly, since I know that electric fields from", 
    "different charges should be added vectorially, it is clear", 
    "that the relation should also hold for any collection of", 
    "charges inside the bag.", 
    "And therefore, we now arrive at our first milestone in", 
    "8.02, which we call Gauss's Law.", 
    "And Gauss's Law says that the flux, the electric flux, going", 
    "through a closed surface, being the closed surface", 
    "integral of E dot dA is the sum of all charges, Q, which", 
    "are inside the bag that you may choose at any time you", 
    "pick that bag, divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "And this is the first of four equations of Maxwell, which", 
    "are at the heart of this course.", 
    "So the electric flux through any closed surface is always", 
    "the charge inside that closed surface divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "And if that flux happens to be zero, it means there's no net", 
    "charge inside the bag.", 
    "There could be positive, there could be negative charges, but", 
    "the net is zero.", 
    "Gauss's Law always holds, no matter how weird the charge", 
    "distribution inside the bag.", 
    "No matter how weird the shape of this bag.", 
    "It always holds.", 
    "But Gauss's Law won't help you very much if you don't have a", 
    "situation whereby the charges are distributed in a very", 
    "symmetric way.", 
    "Gauss's Law holds, but it doesn't do you any good if you", 
    "want to calculate the electric field.", 
    "In order to calculate successfully the electric", 
    "field, you do need forms of symmetry.", 
    "And there are three forms of symmetry that we will deal", 
    "with in 8.02.", 
    "One is, of course, spherical symmetry.", 
    "Another one is cylindrical symmetry.", 
    "And a third one is flat planes with uniformly charged", 
    "distributions, then we also have situations of symmetry.", 
    "And so now I would like to, as a first example, use an", 
    "application of Gauss's Law.", 
    "And I will start with a situation", 
    "of spherical symmetry.", 
    "And I use a thin shell, a hollow sphere, which is thin.", 
    "And so this radius is R. And I put charge Q on here, but it", 
    "is uniformly distributed.", 
    "That's crucial.", 
    "If it's is not uniformly", 
    "distributed, I have no symmetry.", 
    "I can't do the problem.", 
    "So it's uniformly distributed.", 
    "We will learn later in the course that it's very easy to", 
    "do this because any conductor of this shape, if you bring", 
    "charge on it, will automatically distribute", 
    "itself uniformly.", 
    "So we have the charge +Q on there uniformly distributed,", 
    "that's a must.", 
    "And I would like to know now what is the electric field", 
    "here at a distance r from the center?", 
    "And what is the electric field here at a", 
    "distance r from the center?", 
    "In other words, I want to know, what is the electric", 
    "field is everywhere in space just due to this uniformly", 
    "charged sphere.", 
    "And with Gauss's Law it just goes like that.", 
    "You now have to choose your Gauss surface.", 
    "And if you don't choose it in a clever way, you get nowhere.", 
    "In a case like this, I would think it is rather obvious", 
    "that the Gauss surfaces that you would choose are", 
    "themselves spheres, concentric spheres.", 
    "If you want to know what the electric field is at this", 
    "point, you choose a sphere with this radius r going", 
    "through that point.", 
    "If you want to know what it here is, you choose a sphere", 
    "going through that point.", 
    "All the way enclosed, it's a concentric sphere.", 
    "And now, you have to use symmetry arguments.", 
    "And the symmetry arguments are the following.", 
    "Since this is spherically symmetric, this problem, if", 
    "you were here, whatever the electric field is here in", 
    "magnitude must be the same as it is there, and it must be", 
    "the same as it is there.", 
    "Because of the symmetry of the problem.", 
    "Couldn't be any larger here then it could be here.", 
    "That's obvious.", 
    "That's a symmetry argument because the charge here is", 
    "uniformly distributed.", 
    "That's symmetry argument number one.", 
    "Now comes another symmetry argument.", 
    "And that is, the electric field, if there is an electric", 
    "field, must be either radially pointing outwards or radially", 
    "pointing inwards.", 
    "So either it has to be like this or it", 
    "has to be like this.", 
    "And here the same, either like this, or like this, because we", 
    "already know if this is a positive charge that it's", 
    "going to be pointing outwards.", 
    "It cannot go like this or like this because nature could not", 
    "decide in this spherically symmetric problem to go like", 
    "this or like this.", 
    "It can only go radially.", 
    "That's a second symmetry argument.", 
    "So now, if we go to this sphere now, and we know that E", 
    "is radially outwards, apart from a plus or a minus sign,", 
    "apart from the fact that the angle between dA and E could", 
    "either be 0 degrees or 180 degrees.", 
    "We know now that the surface area of that sphere, which is", 
    "4 pi r squared, times the magnitude of the E vector", 
    "right here, I can do that now because the A and E are either", 
    "parallel or antiparallel.", 
    "That must be equal to Q inside divided by epsilon zero.", 
    "There is Q inside, so E must be zero.", 
    "That's an amazing result.", 
    "You say, well, there's no charge inside.", 
    "Still, an amazing result.", 
    "Because it means that anywhere inside here, no matter what", 
    "radius you choose, the electric field", 
    "equals exactly zero.", 
    "And it means there is some crazy conspiracy of all these", 
    "charges that are uniformly distributed here, which each", 
    "individually contribute to the electric field inside through", 
    "Coulomb's law, that all those together through a conspiracy", 
    "make the E field everywhere inside zero.", 
    "It's a nontrivial result.", 
    "All right, so now we know the E field inside is zero.", 
    "So this is for r smaller than R. Let's now go r larger than", 
    "R. Everything I told you holds for the sphere, which is", 
    "outside this hollow sphere.", 
    "Everything holds.", 
    "The E field here must be the same", 
    "everywhere on the surface.", 
    "dA and E are either parallel or antiparallel.", 
    "So I can write down again that 4 pi r squared, which is the", 
    "surface area, times the electric field vector must be", 
    "the Q inside divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "But this Q is that Q. It's not zero.", 
    "There is charge inside.", 
    "And so now I know that the electric field, E, in terms of", 
    "its magnitude is Q divided by 4 pi r squared epsilon 0.", 
    "And we know the direction, if it is positive, of course, it", 
    "is radially outwards.", 
    "And if this is negative, it's radially inwards.", 
    "And this is a non-trivial result.", 
    "We have seen this before.", 
    "If I had put all the charge right here at the middle, at", 
    "the center, we would have gotten", 
    "exactly the same answer.", 
    "We've seen that before.", 
    "In other words, whether the charge is uniformly", 
    "distributed over a sphere, or whether the charge is, all of", 
    "it, exactly at the center of the sphere that makes no", 
    "difference for the E field, as long as you", 
    "are outside the sphere.", 
    "If you plot the electric field as a function of r.", 
    "And if here is capital R. And if this is the field strength,", 
    "then you would get that the electric field is zero inside", 
    "jumps to a maximum value.", 
    "And this falls off as 1 over r squared, proportional to 1", 
    "over r squared.", 
    "If I go back to the situation that the electric field inside", 
    "is zero, you may say isn't that a little bit of a cheat?", 
    "Because, yeah, there is no charge inside, but have you", 
    "really used the charge outside?", 
    "And if you have used it, how did you use it?", 
    "Well, I have used it.", 
    "I use it through my symmetry arguments.", 
    "The symmetry arguments take into account that the charge", 
    "is uniformly distributed.", 
    "If the charge on the sphere had not been uniformly", 
    "distributed, I could not have used the symmetry argument.", 
    "And therefore, the electric field inside would, in fact,", 
    "not have been zero.", 
    "If there is more charge on the sphere here than there is", 
    "there the field inside the sphere is not zero.", 
    "So I have used all that charge by using my symmetry argument.", 
    "Gauss's Law and Coulomb's Law, in a way, are the same law.", 
    "They both link the electric field with the charge Q. Key", 
    "is the fact that the electric force falls", 
    "off as 1 over r squared.", 
    "If the electric field strengths did not fall off as", 
    "1 over r squared, Gauss's Law would not even hold.", 
    "And the electric field inside this uniformly charged sphere", 
    "would not be zero.", 
    "So it is the immediate consequence of the fact that", 
    "electric forces fall off as 1 over r squared.", 
    "Gravitational forces also fall off as 1 over r squared.", 
    "Therefore, if you take a planet, if it existed, which", 
    "is a hollow spherical planet with hollow inside, it means", 
    "there would be no gravitational field inside", 
    "that hollow planet.", 
    "So if you were there, there would be no gravitational", 
    "force on you.", 
    "If it is spherical.", 
    "If that planet were a cubical planet, then the gravitational", 
    "field inside would not be zero.", 
    "You say, well, big deal, with 8.01 we always take a planet,", 
    "and then as far as we're outside the planet we put all", 
    "the mass and we consider it as a point.", 
    "Yeah, indeed, it's not a big deal for you.", 
    "And it is not a big deal for me.", 
    "But it was a big deal for Newton.", 
    "He intuitively sensed that it was correct.", 
    "That if you have a planet of uniform mass distribution that", 
    "you can consider it as a point mass, as long as you're", 
    "outside the planet.", 
    "But it took him 20 years to prove it.", 
    "And he finally published his results.", 
    "It would take us now 30 seconds.", 
    "He didn't have access to Gauss's Law.", 
    "It came about 100 years later.", 
    "But the net result is, that you see here in front of you,", 
    "that if you have uniformly charged distribution and you", 
    "draw the parallel with gravity that you get the same electric", 
    "field outside that you would have gotten if all the charge", 
    "is at one location, at the center.", 
    "This is spherical symmetry number one.", 
    "That's the easiest symmetry that we have in 8.02.", 
    "Now, I will present you with a second form of symmetry, which", 
    "is a flat horizontal plane.", 
    "And I want you to work out most of it, but I'll help you", 
    "a little bit to set it up.", 
    "Suppose we have a plane, which is very, very large.", 
    "Think of it, for now, as infinitely large.", 
    "It doesn't exist, of course, infinitely large.", 
    "And I put on this plane charge.", 
    "And I put a certain amount of charge density,", 
    "which I call sigma.", 
    "Sigma is an amount of charge Q per area A. So it is a certain", 
    "number of coulombs per square meter.", 
    "And it's uniformly distributed, so the whole", 
    "plane everywhere has the same number of coulombs per square", 
    "meter, or microcoulombs or nano coulombs,", 
    "whatever you prefer.", 
    "And this is a plane which is huge.", 
    "And you are being asked, what is the electric", 
    "field anywhere in space?", 
    "Just like before, we ask, what is the electric field anywhere", 
    "inside the sphere, and anywhere outside the sphere?", 
    "Now I want to know what it is anywhere in the vicinity of", 
    "this plane.", 
    "If now you pick a clever Gauss surface, the answer pops out", 
    "very quickly.", 
    "If you would choose a sphere as a Gauss surface, you're", 
    "dead in the water.", 
    "You get nowhere.", 
    "Because there's no spherical symmetry.", 
    "I will define for you that Gauss surface.", 
    "But I want you to work out at home how you get", 
    "the electric field.", 
    "Suppose I want to know what the electric field is at a", 
    "distance, d, above the plane.", 
    "What I do now is I choose this as my Gauss surface.", 
    "Watch me closely, this is the intersection with the plane.", 
    "This is my Gauss surface.", 
    "It is a closed surface.", 
    "Three conditions have to be met for you to be able to", 
    "calculate what the E vector is at that location d.", 
    "The first one is that this is a flat plane here, and this is", 
    "the same flat plane.", 
    "It must be parallel to this plane.", 
    "That's a must.", 
    "If you don't do that, you can't use Gauss's Law.", 
    "The second one is that these vertical walls that you have", 
    "here are indeed perpendicular to that plane.", 
    "In other words, these are parallel.", 
    "And these are exactly vertical.", 
    "If you don't make them vertical, if you do this,", 
    "you're dead in the water.", 
    "Can't use Gauss's Law very effectively.", 
    "And then, the third argument, which is very important, that", 
    "this flat surface is a distance, d, above the plane,", 
    "and that this flat surface is exactly the same distance", 
    "below the plane.", 
    "You can already smell why that is important because if you", 
    "ever want to use a symmetry argument.", 
    "If this plane is uniformly charged, the electric field", 
    "vector here, in terms of magnitude, obviously must be", 
    "the same as there in terms of magnitude.", 
    "Maybe not in terms of direction.", 
    "As long as this d is the same as that d.", 
    "So that's why it's important that the two d's are the same.", 
    "And the only charge that you have inside when you apply", 
    "Gauss's Law is the charge which is, of course, here.", 
    "That's the only charge inside that closed box.", 
    "If you work this out at home you will", 
    "find an amazing result.", 
    "You will find that the electric flux through these", 
    "vertical walls is zero.", 
    "Nothing comes out through the vertical walls.", 
    "Think about it.", 
    "Why that is.", 
    "Use symmetry arguments.", 
    "But something comes out here, or comes in here if it is a", 
    "negative charge, and something goes out here.", 
    "And so you only have two contributions from those two", 
    "end plates."
