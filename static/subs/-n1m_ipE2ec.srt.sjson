    "WALTER LEWIN: If these were the only forces that acted on", 
    "the protons, and you bring them in the nucleus, which has", 
    "a size of only 10 to the -12 centimeters, then the", 
    "acceleration that the proton will experience is the", 
    "electric force divided by the mass of the", 
    "proton, F equals ma.", 
    "Basis of 8.01.", 
    "And if you take this electric force when you make d, 10 to", 
    "the -12 centimeters, which is 10 to the -14 meters, you", 
    "calculate this ratio, you will find that it is 26 orders of", 
    "magnitude higher than the gravitational", 
    "acceleration on Earth.", 
    "26 orders of magnitude higher, so you wonder what the hell", 
    "holds the nucleus together if there's such a tremendous", 
    "force on these protons.", 
    "Well, what is holding them together are the nuclear", 
    "forces, which we do not fully understand.", 
    "But thank goodness, the nuclear force is not part of", 
    "8.02, so I'll leave that alone for now.", 
    "So what holds our world together?", 
    "Well, on the nuclear scale, 10 to the -12 centimeters, very", 
    "important are the nuclear forces.", 
    "On an atomic scale, up to thousands of kilometers, is", 
    "really electric forces that hold our world together.", 
    "But on a much larger scale, planets, stars and the galaxy,", 
    "it is gravity that holds our world together.", 
    "And now you may say, that's very inconsistent with what", 
    "you've just told us, because didn't you tell us that d", 
    "cancels if you compare gravity which electricity?", 
    "Yes, but keep in mind that most objects in the universe", 
    "have only a very small amount of charge per unit mass.", 
    "The Earth and Mars have each a charge of about 400,000", 
    "coulombs, the gravitational force between them is", 
    "therefore about 17 orders of magnitude larger than the", 
    "electric force.", 
    "So even though our immediate surroundings are dominated by", 
    "electric forces, including your own body for that matter,", 
    "the behavior of the universe on a large scale is dictated", 
    "by gravity.", 
    "We will use various instruments to measure charge", 
    "in a quantitative way.", 
    "And one of the instruments that you will see, we will use", 
    "it often in lectures that are to come, is called an", 
    "electroscope.", 
    "It's a very simple instrument.", 
    "In general, it is just a conducting rod, could be", 
    "aluminum, metal.", 
    "And at the end are two pieces of tinsel, two pieces of", 
    "aluminum foil.", 
    "And often there is a nice knob here.", 
    "And if I touch this with a charged object, then because", 
    "this can conduct electricity, it can conduct the fire, as", 
    "defined by Benjamin Franklin.", 
    "If I touch it with an object which is positively charged,", 
    "then this object will become positively charged.", 
    "If I touch it with an object that is negatively charged, it", 
    "will become negatively charged.", 
    "And you see, now, here these two very light pieces of", 
    "aluminum foil will repel each other.", 
    "And so you will see that this shows a certain angle, and the", 
    "more charge there is, the larger that angle.", 
    "For it gives us a way of doing some quantitative", 
    "measurements.", 
    "There are other electroscopes, which are not too different.", 
    "There's one central rod, and they would have one leaf", 
    "hanging there.", 
    "And when you charge that one up, then this leaf will go", 
    "out, and if the charge is more it will go out even further.", 
    "I don't have an electroscope now here.", 
    "But what I want you to see that if I charge myself up and", 
    "I hold in my hand this Christmas tree tinsels, that", 
    "in a way, if I get enough charge on me, then these", 
    "tinsels will spread out.", 
    "It's an idea that immediately follows from the fact that you", 
    "get a certain amount of charge, whether it's negative", 
    "charge for me or whether I'm positively charged, that", 
    "doesn't make any difference, these tinsels will spread out.", 
    "And of course, the best way I can do that is to charge", 
    "myself with the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And as I said earlier, experiments of this nature are", 
    "not entirely without risk.", 
    "And so there's always the possibility, of course, that I", 
    "don't survive this demonstration.", 
    "But don't worry, because in that case, there will be", 
    "someone else who will lecture 8.02, except he's not likely", 
    "to show this demonstration again.", 
    "So you might as well take a close look because this may be", 
    "the only time you will ever see it.", 
    "So I will give you some nice light on the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And it's always a scary moment for me.", 
    "Sleepless nights about the Van de Graaff.", 
    "Am I going to turn it on, Marcos, or do you have the", 
    "courage to turn in on?", 
    "You'll turn it on?", 
    "OK, hold it Marcos, this is too close for comfort.", 
    "You ready?", 
    "Are you nervous?", 
    "See you.", 
    "So look at the tinsels, and try not to look at me, please.", 
    "Go ahead.", 
    "I am now a living spectroscope.", 
    "If the weather is cooperating today, and if I had long hair,", 
    "you might even see that my hair would start to act like", 
    "an electroscope.", 
    "We can try that too.", 
    "Why don't you throw it?", 
    "Is it working?", 
    "OK, well, this weekend make sure you take this nylon shirt", 
    "off in front of the mirror and enjoy the experiment at home.", 
    "Don't try this ever.", 
    "See you Friday.", 
    "That effectively is a fuse.", 
    "You drive so much current that there is one element in your", 
    "circuit that can't handle the current and that melts.", 
    "And that's a good thing because a fuse then prevents", 
    "worse things from happening.", 
    "Suppose there were an electric short somewhere in your desk", 
    "lamp, and that could cause a fire.", 
    "You get a tremendous current going and you can cause a", 
    "fire, and the fuse goes, and that stops the current.", 
    "And so you already have seen, in a way, how a fuse works.", 
    "Let's see what we're doing now on the--", 
    "Let's see what the voltage is that we have achieved.", 
    "Why don't I see the voltage coming up?", 
    "I just want to know what the voltage is on the--", 
    "No, that's number four.", 
    "It's number three should work.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "On the bottom, we have 3,000 volts there.", 
    "And what are we going to do is we're going to dump the energy", 
    "that we have now, which is something like 450 joules,", 
    "we're going to dump that through an iron wire, which is", 
    "in this case there.", 
    "Some of you may be able to see this iron wire.", 
    "The wire is 12 inches long, and the thickness", 
    "is .030 of an inch.", 
    "And when we dump this energy through this wire, it will get", 
    "hot and it will melt and that's the idea of a fuse.", 
    "So you'll probably, if it works, you probably see a", 
    "little bit of light, and then the fuse will melt.", 
    "So I have to really think when I do this that", 
    "I do nothing stupid.", 
    "I stopped the charging.", 
    "And then I will dump this energy through the wire.", 
    "We can also check once we have done that, once the fuse is", 
    "gone, whether there is some energy left in the capacitor.", 
    "And we can do that by shortening the capacitor out", 
    "and see whether there's a spark that we would see.", 
    "It's likely that not all the energy will be", 
    "dissipated in the iron.", 
    "It's possible that there is some energy left.", 
    "So let me think now, did I do everything right?", 
    "Yes.", 
    "I disconnected the charger.", 
    "And so if you watch carefully now, now you", 
    "may see some light.", 
    "So I'm now going to discharge it.", 
    "Oh my goodness.", 
    "So that's the way a fuse works.", 
    "Have you never heard them in your", 
    "basement go off like that?", 
    "Now, let's see whether there is energy", 
    "left on this capacitor.", 
    "Here I have a solid conductor and I'm going to short out", 
    "this capacitor to see whether there's any energy left.", 
    "Three, two, one, zero.", 
    "There was some left but most of it came out there.", 
    "OK, see you Friday."
