    "WALTER LEWIN: 0 here, and it is 0 here.", 
    "Why is that?", 
    "Because the cross product is 0.", 
    "No matter how you look at it, you can say dl and B are", 
    "either in the same direction or in opposite directions.", 
    "You can also say the drift velocity and B are either in", 
    "the same or the opposite direction.", 
    "It's all the same thing.", 
    "There is no force here, and there is no force here because", 
    "that equation that we had that gives us the magnetic", 
    "force becomes 0.", 
    "The sine of that angle is 0.", 
    "So what's going to happen with this thing?", 
    "Well, there's a torque on this system.", 
    "There is no net force because this force up is the same as", 
    "this force down.", 
    "But there is a torque, which wants to rotate it in", 
    "counterclockwise direction.", 
    "And the magnitude of that torque is, of", 
    "course, this force--", 
    "you remember from 8.01--", 
    "times the perpendicular distance", 
    "between these two forces.", 
    "And so the magnitude of that torque is I times ab times B", 
    "at this moment in time, when the forces are this far apart.", 
    "Now this is going to rotate.", 
    "And so as they rotate, these forces come closer.", 
    "And so the torque will become less still, it wants to rotate", 
    "counterclockwise.", 
    "And there comes a time, 90 degrees later, that", 
    "the torque is 0.", 
    "And I will try to make you see that, again, in a three", 
    "dimensional way.", 
    "It's not so easy for me.", 
    "Now this is D, this has become D. The current always leaves", 
    "at D. I'll try to make you see this three dimensionally.", 
    "It goes like this.", 
    "The current comes in here at A. So we get", 
    "this, and we get this.", 
    "Doesn't look so bad.", 
    "And the magnetic field B has not changed, uniform B in the", 
    "same direction.", 
    "So the current now comes in through A. It has not changed.", 
    "The only thing is that the loop has rotated 90 degrees.", 
    "If now I ask you what the forces are, you have to go I", 
    "cross B. I cross B--", 
    "if you do I cross B here, I cross B, you get a force which", 
    "is towards you.", 
    "Here you get forces which are in the blackboard.", 
    "Here you get forces which are up, and here you get forces", 
    "which are down.", 
    "At home you will have some time to use your right hand", 
    "and do the I cross B. And you will see then that, indeed,", 
    "all these forces are in the direction that I put them.", 
    "So now, there is, again, no net force on the system.", 
    "There was no net force here either, but now there is no", 
    "torque either.", 
    "So now the torque has become 0.", 
    "If we rotate it a little further, it is possible when", 
    "we start this motor, it starts to rotate counterclockwise.", 
    "Comes to this position, torque goes to 0.", 
    "But it has enough inertia, so it rotates a little further.", 
    "And now the torque will reverse.", 
    "And this is something that I leave you alone with.", 
    "I don't want to make another drawing and convince you that", 
    "it reverses.", 
    "But it's easy to see because take this thing and just flip", 
    "it over 180 degrees.", 
    "The magnetic field hasn't changed, but the current in", 
    "these two sides have changed direction now because whatever", 
    "is D is here, and A is here.", 
    "And so the torque reverses.", 
    "And so it goes like this--", 
    "whoosh--", 
    "and then-- whoosh-- it comes back.", 
    "And that's not much of a motor.", 
    "Current meters are very frequently used.", 
    "They are in your car-- has many more than you think.", 
    "Your fuel gauge and your temperature of the cooling", 
    "water are current meters.", 
    "And a current meter works as follows.", 
    "We attach to this loop a needle, and we", 
    "calibrate it here.", 
    "And you can read how many amperes are going", 
    "through this meter.", 
    "It wants to go counterclockwise.", 
    "Here we attach a spring, and the spring", 
    "produces a counter torque.", 
    "And so the needle will start to deflect but come to a halt.", 
    "But if you double the current, it will go further.", 
    "That's the way that a current meter works.", 
    "And your fuel gauge in your car is a current meter, except", 
    "that the level of the fuel is somehow converted into an", 
    "electric signal.", 
    "And then it's sent through a current meter, and that's what", 
    "you're reading.", 
    "It is, of course, calibrated in terms of how", 
    "much fuel you have.", 
    "And your temperature gauge is calibrated in terms of", 
    "degrees, whatever, Fahrenheit or whatever.", 
    "So these current meters are very common, even when we're", 
    "dealing with something that has", 
    "nothing to do with current.", 
    "How do you build now a motor that works?", 
    "How do you get over this torque reversal?", 
    "Well, it's not only the torque reversal that is a problem.", 
    "But there is also the problem that, if you could keep this", 
    "going around, that these two wires would intertwine and", 
    "they would break.", 
    "If you roll it around a 100 times, you can see what", 
    "happens at A and D. They'll break.", 
    "So you have to think of a design whereby you have", 
    "slipping contacts.", 
    "We call them brushes.", 
    "Suppose I have here a conductor which is connected", 
    "with A, physically, solid, to the wire at A. And here I have", 
    "a conductor which is D. So the loop is where you are.", 
    "Solid wires coming out, the loop is here.", 
    "But now the battery--", 
    "plus side of the battery is here, and the minus side of", 
    "the battery of here.", 
    "And this is a slipping contact.", 
    "In practice, we call them brushes.", 
    "So that immediately takes care of the problem that", 
    "the wires wind up.", 
    "But there's something else which is very clever about", 
    "this design.", 
    "If the gap between A and D is an insulator, then what's", 
    "going to happen when this rotates 180 degrees, A, which", 
    "now is on the positive side of the battery--", 
    "this is negative, of course--", 
    "A is now on the positive side of the battery.", 
    "If you rotate 180 degrees, A will be on the negative side", 
    "of the battery.", 
    "So now every rotation, the current will, all by itself,", 
    "change direction.", 
    "And we call that a commutator.", 
    "And so now what's going to happen is, now the torque", 
    "reversal will not occur.", 
    "If, at the right moment, the current switches direction,", 
    "the torque will always want to rotate the loop in exactly the", 
    "same direction.", 
    "And that's the idea behind a commutator.", 
    "The great 8.02 Motor Contest.", 
    "You have an envelope.", 
    "When you open it up-- don't do it now--", 
    "you'll find in there a copper wire, two meters insulated", 
    "copper wire, two magnets, two paper clips, and some wood.", 
    "And the idea is that you try to build a motor that runs as", 
    "fast as possible.", 
    "For every 100 rpm--", 
    "an rpm is a rotation per minute--", 
    "for every 100 rpm, I'll give you one credit point, with a", 
    "maximum of 20 credit points.", 
    "So if your motor runs 2000 rpm or more, you", 
    "get 20 credit points.", 
    "That is equivalent to two homework assignments.", 
    "And these credit points come over and", 
    "above your course grade.", 
    "You have my word for that.", 
    "It will give you a final course grade, the way that", 
    "you've seen in the ground rules of the first handout,", 
    "and we add your motor contest, what you deserved.", 
    "For every 100 rpm, you get one point plus, with", 
    "a maximum of 20.", 
    "And we're going to test these motors on the 2nd of April.", 
    "And I gave you a handout in which I give you some hints,", 
    "some ideas.", 
    "There's one idea that I gave you which you may ignore, and", 
    "that is, to overcome the torque reversal you can build", 
    "a commutator.", 
    "Well, that's really not easy.", 
    "And not only is it not easy, but when you build a", 
    "commutator, your system may get a lot of friction, and you", 
    "may lose more than you gain.", 
    "There is an alternative solution, which I mention in", 
    "my handout that you picked up today.", 
    "And that is that you design your motor in such a way that,", 
    "when the reversal, when the torque reversal occurs, that", 
    "there is no current running anymore.", 
    "And when it is half a rotation further, the", 
    "torque is there again.", 
    "The current is there again.", 
    "So for half the time, you stop the current.", 
    "You'll see that's very easy.", 
    "I give you some hints how you do that.", 
    "So you have to weigh that against the possibility of", 
    "building a commutator.", 
    "The bottom line is the maximum is 20 credit points.", 
    "That's an equivalent of two homework assignments.", 
    "You get it over and above your course grade.", 
    "And it's also great fun, believe me.", 
    "What more do you want?", 
    "To do physics, get credit, and have fun.", 
    "That's what I do every day.", 
    "That's the great thing about physics.", 
    "We have five minutes left, and in those five minutes, I'm", 
    "going to demonstrate to you a motor.", 
    "What you see there is a current loop.", 
    "I'll try to make you see it three dimensionally.", 
    "This is a current loop, and we're going to run a current", 
    "in this direction.", 
    "And we here have a magnet, North, South.", 
    "Magnetic field is in this direction.", 
    "And we here have a magnet, North, South.", 
    "Magnetic field is also in this direction.", 
    "I'm going to run a current through here.", 
    "And if the current is in the blackboard, I cross B--", 
    "I is in, cross B force is up.", 
    "This side wants to go up.", 
    "If this side wants to go up, since the magnetic field is in", 
    "the same direction here, but the current is 180 degrees in", 
    "opposite direction, this force will be down.", 
    "And so there's a torque on this motor.", 
    "And you will see that.", 
    "You will see that go like this.", 
    "However, when it's 180 degrees and it swings here by, it", 
    "wants to go back because of the torque reversal.", 
    "That's the first thing that I want to show you.", 
    "And I think I don't need any changes in the light.", 
    "So here we have this loop, and here we have the two magnets.", 
    "The magnetic field is by no means uniform, by the way.", 
    "It's very strong here, and it's very strong there.", 
    "And now I have to power that, there we go.", 
    "Yeah, I think I know that this one will come up this side.", 
    "I'm fairly sure that I have the directions right.", 
    "Let's first take a look at it.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "So when it's here, notice, it goes up.", 
    "But now, if I power it here again, it wants to go back.", 
    "So here it wants to go up.", 
    "And here it wants to go back.", 
    "So we've got to do something, and that something is a", 
    "commutator.", 
    "So if we can somehow reverse the current when it's here,", 
    "then it wants to go down again.", 
    "I'll show you that.", 
    "So now it's here, and I will drive the current", 
    "in the other direction.", 
    "You ready for that?", 
    "You notice?", 
    "It now wants to go down.", 
    "Now it wants to go down.", 
    "But when it's here, I have to reverse the current.", 
    "It wants to go up.", 
    "And if I do that with my hand, I can see whether I can keep", 
    "this rotating.", 
    "It may take me awhile, but I'll do my best I can.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "Switch, switch, switch, switch, switch, switch,", 
    "switch, switch, switch.", 
    "Yeah, I got it.", 
    "Yeah, I got it.", 
    "I'm a commutator.", 
    "And this motor is going at least 60 rpm.", 
    "That's 1 credit point for me for this course.", 
    "Thank you."
