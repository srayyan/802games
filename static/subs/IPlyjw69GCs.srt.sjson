    "WALTER LEWIN: These heavy balloons may be a little bit", 
    "more difficult.", 
    "Also, I'm wearing cotton.", 
    "If you wear nylon or polyester, it's much better.", 
    "It's much easier to get-- oh, that's good.", 
    "That's a nice one.", 
    "I think we need a blue one.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "So you see, friction causes electricity.", 
    "That's, of course, why the silk, when we rubbed the glass", 
    "and the cat fur, we rubbed the rubber, then we create a", 
    "charge on one.", 
    "Of course, if you make the glass positively charged, your", 
    "silk will be automatically negatively charged.", 
    "When you comb your hair, you may have noticed in dry", 
    "weather that you hear some cracking noise.", 
    "Cracking noise means sparks.", 
    "And you will learn all about sparks in this", 
    "course, though not today.", 
    "But you can hear it if you're very quiet, and as you do", 
    "that, you charge the comb.", 
    "I can hear the cracking.", 
    "Interesting.", 
    "So the comb is now charged.", 
    "Probably so am I, and there it comes.", 
    "See?", 
    "It's not as good as the glass, but same idea.", 
    "If you take your shirt off, and you make it dark in your", 
    "dormitory, and you stand in front of a mirror, an amazing", 
    "experience.", 
    "And I would be happy to do it for you because, but I told", 
    "you I already wear cotton, and it doesn't work", 
    "with cotton so well.", 
    "You really have to do it with a nylon shirt.", 
    "And when you take that nylon shirt off, not only do you", 
    "hear the cracking, but you actually see the glow of these", 
    "teeny little sparks.", 
    "You actually are like a light bulb.", 
    "It is an experiment that you cannot miss.", 
    "And I would suggest you try that this weekend.", 
    "Do it with a friend, that's even more fun.", 
    "We all perhaps remember when you just walk around, do your", 
    "normal things during the day.", 
    "There are rugs in rooms, and you want to leave the room,", 
    "and you touch the door knob.", 
    "You get a shock.", 
    "It's a spark that flies over.", 
    "It's electricity.", 
    "Even when you touch a person, you sometimes feel this shock.", 
    "When you cook, and you take Saran wrap off these rolls,", 
    "the damn stuff just doesn't want to come off.", 
    "Because as you roll it off, there's friction.", 
    "And it gets charged, and it often gets crumbled up.", 
    "And it's very bad, very difficult to handle it.", 
    "You've all experience this.", 
    "Also, cellophane around boxes with chocolate.", 
    "The same thing happens.", 
    "As you take it off, you charge it, whether", 
    "you like it or not.", 
    "I now want to do an experiment,", 
    "and I need a volunteer.", 
    "I need a student who actually is wearing preferably not all", 
    "cotton, but I think Simon, you have a beautiful, wonderful", 
    "nylon parka.", 
    "So if you are willing to sacrifice a little bit for the", 
    "sake of science and come over here, and sit down here.", 
    "Just relax.", 
    "Make sure that your feet are off the ground.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So what I'm going to do now Simon, I'm going to beat you", 
    "with cat fur.", 
    "And as I beat you with cat fur, you will get charged.", 
    "And since I don't want you to be the only person who suffers", 
    "under this experiment, I will also stand on", 
    "an insulated stool.", 
    "So if you become, for instance, positively charged,", 
    "I don't know whether it's positive or negative, I will", 
    "get the other amount of charge.", 
    "So we share in the charge.", 
    "And as I beat you, you will charge up more and more.", 
    "And I will charge up more and more.", 
    "And then we will have to convince the class that we are", 
    "both charged.", 
    "And we will do that in a way that will be hopefully rather", 
    "convincing.", 
    "Let me just start beating you a little bit to", 
    "make you feel at home.", 
    "We know each other, right?", 
    "OK.", 
    "Now of course, as I mentioned to you, these experiments work", 
    "well when it is dry.", 
    "And so if you are too wet, it won't work.", 
    "But let's see, if you sweat a little bit too much, then it", 
    "doesn't work too well.", 
    "So are you ready?", 
    "I have here in my hand a neon flash tube.", 
    "And although we don't know yet what voltage is, because we", 
    "will learn about that in this course, to get a good flash", 
    "out of this, you need about a few thousand volts.", 
    "And so we will see, we'll make it dark shortly.", 
    "And I will hold the flashlight, the flashlight in", 
    "one hand, the neon discharge tube.", 
    "And then Simon will touch it on the other side.", 
    "And if we succeeded, then you may see some light.", 
    "So Simon, look at me first.", 
    "Don't touch it yet, because we're going to make", 
    "it all the way dark.", 
    "You know where it is?", 
    "It's there.", 
    "OK, make it dark, Marcos.", 
    "Touch it.", 
    "Touch it.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Thank you.", 
    "Can we have some light?", 
    "Thank you very much.", 
    "Equal charges repel each other.", 
    "I've shown that, the", 
    "demonstration with the balloons.", 
    "Here we have an instrument which is", 
    "called a Van de Graaff.", 
    "It's named after Professor Van de Graaff who invented it.", 
    "He was an MIT professor.", 
    "And this instrument, which I will not discuss in any detail", 
    "now, but you will understand it later on in the course.", 
    "I'll tell you all about it later.", 
    "Just think of this instrument as a super amber rod.", 
    "And although we don't know yet what voltage is, I mentioned", 
    "already the 20,000 volts between Simon and me.", 
    "In this instrument you have to think in terms of several", 
    "hundred thousand volts.", 
    "So this instrument is not without danger.", 
    "But that, of course, makes it more exciting to work with it.", 
    "So it's a super amber rod.", 
    "And what I will do first, now, is to put", 
    "some confetti on top.", 
    "And when we turn on the Van de Graaff, the confetti may at", 
    "first go to the charge dome, it is already on top of it.", 
    "And when it picks up some of the charge, it will then", 
    "spread out.", 
    "Because it will repel.", 
    "So let's get some light on there, which will make it a", 
    "little bit better to see.", 
    "Let me put some of this on top.", 
    "It's just regular confetti.", 
    "Pieces of paper.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Now all I have to remember is how to start the--", 
    "Most of the action has already occurred.", 
    "I will put a little bit more on.", 
    "If you see sparks, don't worry.", 
    "Yet.", 
    "Put some more on.", 
    "Nothing left for the second class.", 
    "Make it perhaps a little darker.", 
    "That's too dark.", 
    "OK, we'll try it once more.", 
    "Give it a zap.", 
    "So look at the confetti on top.", 
    "And I think it's quite convincing.", 
    "Some of the confetti will stay there.", 
    "Well, that's for reasons that is not a good conductor.", 
    "And so it gets first sucked in, and if it doesn't get", 
    "charged off the Van de Graaff, then it will not spread out.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So now let's try for the first time to be a little bit more", 
    "quantitative.", 
    "If I take two charges, and we use in general, we use for", 
    "charge the symbol q.", 
    "So here we have q1.", 
    "And here we have q2.", 
    "And let's say they are separated by a distance, r.", 
    "And the unit vector in the direction from one to two, I", 
    "call that r roof 1,2.", 
    "The roof stands for unit vector.", 
    "If these charges are equal, both minus or both plus, then", 
    "they will repel each other.", 
    "And so here there is a force, F, which I call 1, 2.", 
    "It is the force on 2 due to number 1.", 
    "And since action equals minus reaction, force here is 2, 1.",

    "Coulomb found the following relationship that the force is", 
    "proportional to the product of the two charges.",
