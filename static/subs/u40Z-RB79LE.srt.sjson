    "WALTER LEWIN: And just for the sake of the argument, suppose", 
    "at VB, the potential is 100 volts.", 
    "So V of B is 100 volts.", 
    "What now is the current?", 
    "Well, current times potential gives me power.", 
    "And so my current is now a million amperes.", 
    "Alternatively, suppose that the potential at B in the wire", 
    "is 100,000 volts, 1,000 times higher.", 
    "Now, the current is only 1,000 amperes.", 
    "Gives me the same power.", 
    "In both cases, I am consuming at a rate of 100 million", 
    "joules per second.", 
    "But I squared R, the heat loss on the way from the power", 
    "station to me, is a million times lower in this case than", 
    "in that case because I is 1,000 times lower.", 
    "And the heat loss goes with I squared.", 
    "And so now you understand why electricity, when it is", 
    "transported from one place to another, why that is done at", 
    "the highest voltage possible.", 
    "When you get to Boston, you obviously got to do something", 
    "about this enormous potential, because if you were to deliver", 
    "100,000 potential difference there, then half the", 
    "population in Boston would electrocute itself.", 
    "So now you've got to come down in voltage, which you do with", 
    "transformers.", 
    "We will talk about that later in the course.", 
    "And so you bring it down to a comfortable voltage, which is,", 
    "in the United States, about 110 volts.", 
    "In Europe, it's 220.", 
    "So now comes the question, how high can you make V of A?", 
    "The higher you could make it, the less loss there would be", 
    "along the way.", 
    "Well, you've got to stay away from the breakdown electric", 
    "field, which is the 3 million volts per meter.", 
    "If at the surface of these cables you get 3 million volts", 
    "per meter, you get corona discharge.", 
    "That's a big loss.", 
    "You want to stay away from that.", 
    "And so typical cables have about a radius r, r is the", 
    "radius of the cable of about two centimeters.", 
    "That gives them a cross sectional area I think of", 
    "about 10 to the minus 3 meters squared.", 
    "That's correct.", 
    "And the potential V at A is roughly 300 kilovolts.", 
    "And with that configuration, you stay comfortably below the", 
    "electric field of 3 million volts per meter.", 
    "So you don't get the corona discharge.", 
    "If the length of that cable, l, if that were something like", 
    "1,000 kilometers, not an unreasonable number.", 
    "1,000 kilometer distance from--", 
    "if we get our electricity from Niagara Falls to Boston, not", 
    "unreasonable number.", 
    "You can calculate now what the resistance of", 
    "that cable would be.", 
    "Because that resistance, R, equals rho times l divided by", 
    "A.", 
    "If you take copper, that has a resistivity of 2 times 10 to", 
    "the minus 8 SI units.", 
    "We have a length of 10 to 6 meters of the cable, and we", 
    "have a cross sectional area of 10 to the", 
    "minus 3 square meters.", 
    "So that 1,000 kilometer cable would only have a resistance", 
    "of 20 ohms.", 
    "And to make the numbers a little easy, if we have a", 
    "current, say, of 300 amperes, then the power that the power", 
    "station produces, if we take the 300 kilovolts for now,", 
    "that power would be the 300 kilovolts", 
    "times the 300 amperes.", 
    "And that is about 90 megawatts.", 
    "That's close to my 100 that I had in mind earlier.", 
    "So you can calculate now what the loss is.", 
    "The loss is I squared R. You know R is 20 ohms.", 
    "You know I, 300 amperes.", 
    "And so you'll find now that you have", 
    "about 2 megawatt loss.", 
    "That's not bad.", 
    "2 out of 90.", 
    "So we have about 2% energy loss in transportation.", 
    "You could also calculate now what the difference is in", 
    "potential between the power station and Boston.", 
    "VA minus VB is I R. You know that I is 300 amperes, and you", 
    "know that R is 20 ohms.", 
    "So VA minus VB is about 6 kilovolts.", 
    "In other words, if the power station puts it on the line at", 
    "300 kilovolts, then you would get it here with only 6", 
    "kilovolts less.", 
    "So that's not a very unreasonable situation.", 
    "I told you that these power lines have to stay away from", 
    "the 3 million volts per meter electric field because then", 
    "you get corona discharge.", 
    "And when there is thunderstorms in the area, it", 
    "can actually push up the electric field on the wire,", 
    "and you can get corona discharge.", 
    "I have seen that several times.", 
    "Not only seen it at night with my naked eyes, that you see", 
    "the power lines glow, but I've also heard it because you can", 
    "hear this cracking noise of corona discharge.", 
    "It's very fascinating, actually.", 
    "I have a slide here which shows that.", 
    "So here you see a high voltage power line, transmission line,", 
    "and you clearly see the glowing", 
    "of the corona discharge.", 
    "They compare that with what's called De Roma's kite string.", 
    "Kite strings at night when you fly them near thunderstorms", 
    "can also produce corona discharge and light.", 
    "That's why they call it De Roma's kite string candles.", 
    "Benjamin Franklin did quite a bit of experiments at night", 
    "with kites near thunderstorms.", 
    "Dangerous business, by the way.", 
    "So you see that these high voltage power lines can go", 
    "into a corona discharge.", 
    "I now want to revisit our Leyden jar.", 
    "We had a truly absurd situation whereby we did an", 
    "experiment with a jar, which you still see here.", 
    "And I will redo the demonstration.", 
    "But it's crying for an explanation because it looked", 
    "like there was something wrong with physics.", 
    "And I want to refresh your memory of what we have seen", 
    "before and what this Leyden jar is all about.", 
    "The Leyden jar is nothing but a capacitor with a dielectric", 
    "between two conductors in the form, in the shape, of a", 
    "bottle, the jar.", 
    "And so the inner portion, which is glass,", 
    "say, has this shape.", 
    "You see?", 
    "You see it there.", 
    "You're going to see it shortly there.", 
    "And then we have conductors, a conducting", 
    "beaker around it here.", 
    "And we have a conducting beaker on the inside.", 
    "And we charge this up with the Wimshurst.", 
    "This is the Wimshurst machine.", 
    "And when we do that, we get free charge on the conductor.", 
    "And so you get sigma free right here,", 
    "and you get it here.", 
    "Opposite signs, of course.", 
    "And you get sigma induced on the dielectric.", 
    "Why do you get it?", 
    "Because the dielectric sees an external field due to this", 
    "sigma free.", 
    "So it begins to polarize, and so you get here induced", 
    "charge, and you get there induced charge.", 
    "If this side is positive, then the induced charge here will", 
    "be negative and vice versa.", 
    "We have here a metal hook, so that we can lift", 
    "out the inner portion.", 
    "So what we did, we charged it up with the Wimshurst.", 
    "And then there's a certain amount of energy.", 
    "The electrostatic potential energy of this configuration", 
    "is 1/2 Q free times the potential difference.", 
    "And the Q free is the charge which is", 
    "on the outer conductor.", 
    "And what I then did, I disassembled it very carefully", 
    "after we had charged it up.", 
    "Took the inner portion out, took the glass out, the outer", 
    "portion, and I took all the free charge off.", 
    "I touched the conductors and discharged them.", 
    "So there's no Q free left.", 
    "It's gone.", 
    "The moment that that is gone, the induced charge must also", 
    "go away because the induced charge is only there because", 
    "of the free charge.", 
    "Remember, the induced charge density is 1 minus 1 over", 
    "kappa times sigma free.", 
    "So if glass has a kappa of 5, then the induced surface", 
    "charge density is about 0.8 times the free", 
    "surface charge density.", 
    "The moment that the free one goes, the induced one goes.", 
    "And then I assembled it again.", 
    "And much to our surprise, when I short out the inner portion", 
    "with the outer portion, we show a huge spark.", 
    "That means there was energy left.", 
    "And that is very puzzling.", 
    "There cannot be any energy left, unless there's something", 
    "wrong with physics.", 
    "So I first want to show that again to remind you of what", 
    "you have seen before.", 
    "And then I'll make a proposal for an explanation.", 
    "Let me check my light configuration.", 
    "Oh, we're going to make it all dark.", 
    "I can charge it up while you're seeing it, actually.", 
    "Yeah.", 
    "Make it dark now.", 
    "And now I will disassemble it.", 
    "I take the inner portion out.", 
    "The glass is a good insulator, so I don't mind touching that", 
    "with my hand.", 
    "OK, and so now I take the inner conductor.", 
    "Touch it.", 
    "Lick it.", 
    "Kiss it.", 
    "Take all the charge off.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "Do the same with the outer conductor.", 
    "Have it in my hand.", 
    "For sure, there's no Q free left on that anymore.", 
    "I put the glass back in again, and then I put the inner", 
    "portion again.", 
    "And now I'll make it a little darker for you because I want", 
    "you to see that when I short this out, that you're going to", 
    "see a spark.", 
    "So I'm going to turn the lights down.", 
    "So look very closely.", 
    "I'll tell you when I'm going to do it.", 
    "Three, two, one.", 
    "I'm approaching it now.", 
    "Zero.", 
    "And there's a huge spark.", 
    "That means energy.", 
    "And that's crazy.", 
    "There shouldn't be any.", 
    "And so some of you must have had sleepless nights not being", 
    "able to explain this.", 
    "Some of you actually wrote me email.", 
    "You didn't have sleepless nights.", 
    "I can tell that.", 
    "So what's going on?", 
    "There's only one possibility, and that is there must be free", 
    "charge on the glass.", 
    "How did it get there?", 
    "Well, corona discharge.", 
    "That's the only way it can get there.", 
    "Keep in mind that the electric field in air, E in air, can be", 
    "no larger than 3 times 10 to the 6 volts per meter.", 
    "If it gets larger, you get corona discharge.", 
    "In glass, by the way, it's a bit higher.", 
    "It's 10 to the 7 volts per meter.", 
    "I will now make some calculations based on certain", 
    "assumptions.", 
    "And those assumptions may not be exactly accurate because I", 
    "don't know the exact dimensions of this system.", 
    "But the exact dimensions don't matter.", 
    "What matters is the idea behind it, why it does such", 
    "crazy things.", 
    "So first of all, I will assume that this capacitor is just", 
    "two parallel plane plates.", 
    "That's a simplified situation because it has", 
    "the shape of a bottle.", 
    "I will assume that the Wimshurst", 
    "produces about 30 kilovolts.", 
    "I know that's approximately right, but it may be 25.", 
    "It may be 35.", 
    "I will assume that the air gap between the outer conductor", 
    "and the glass is one millimeter, that both are 1", 
    "millimeter.", 
    "And I will assume that the glass thickness is 3", 
    "millimeters.", 
    "And I take kappa equals 5 for the glass.", 
    "So that is the basis of my calculations.", 
    "So now I have here the conductor on the outside.", 
    "This is the glass.", 
    "And this is the conductor on the inside.", 
    "So this is 1 millimeter thick, this is 3 millimeters thick,", 
    "and this is 1 millimeter thick.", 
    "And the potential difference over the whole thing is going", 
    "to be 30 kilovolts.", 
    "But I know that the potential difference is", 
    "always E times d.", 
    "That holds for this gap, the local E times this d, the", 
    "local E times this d, and the local E times that d.", 
    "I also know that E glass is the same as E in the air", 
    "divided by that kappa, which is 5.", 
    "And I know that the total potential difference between", 
    "here and here must be 30,000 volts.", 
    "And so this allows me now to calculate, in a very", 
    "straightforward way, the electric field here in the", 
    "air, electric field here in the air, and the electric", 
    "field in the glass because I get a simple", 
    "equation with one unknown.", 
    "And that's the following.", 
    "I first go over this gap, and so I get E in the air times", 
    "the distance, d, which is one millimeter.", 
    "But of course later on, I have to go through this gap again,", 
    "so I multiply it by 2 now.", 
    "And now I have to add the electric field in the glass,", 
    "which is the same as air divided by 5, times its", 
    "distance, which is three millimeters.", 
    "And that must now be 30,000 because that's the potential", 
    "difference between here and there.", 
    "That's one equation with one unknown.", 
    "And I can calculate the electric field in the air gap.", 
    "And the electric field in the air gap turns out to be 11.5", 
    "times 10 to the 6 volts per meter.", 
    "It's here the same, of course, 11.5 times 10 to the 6.", 
    "And here it is 5 times smaller.", 
    "So I find here 2.3 times 10 to the 6.", 
    "To show you that I did my homework correctly, the", 
    "potential difference here is now 11.5 kilovolts.", 
    "I put it here in kilovolts.", 
    "The potential difference here is now about 7 kilovolts.", 
    "And the potential difference here is the", 
    "same, is 11.5 kilovolts.", 
    "And if you add them up, you get 30.", 
    "If you look at this, this cannot be.", 
    "Because a field of 11.5 times 10 to 6 is way above the", 
    "breakdown electric field.", 
    "And so what's going to happen, you're going to get corona", 
    "discharge from the conductor to the glass.", 
    "And so what you're doing is you're spraying", 
    "charge on the glass.", 
    "And that's the key to the solution of", 
    "this bizarre behavior.", 
    "And so when you later disassemble it, and you take", 
    "the free charge of the conductors, there's still this", 
    "free charge that you have sprayed on the glass.", 
    "I never removed that.", 
    "It's very hard to remove because", 
    "the glass is an insulator.", 
    "It's very difficult to take charge off an insulator.", 
    "It's easy to take it off a conductor.", 
    "But I never even attempted that because I made you", 
    "believe, as I believed myself for years, that once you take", 
    "the Q free of the conductor, that there can be no", 
    "charge on the glass.", 
    "That is wrong because there's corona discharge.", 
    "So now comes the question, before we disassemble, what", 
    "now is the configuration of the electric fields and the", 
    "potentials?", 
    "I'll make a drawing here.", 
    "And so now I draw again the conductor, the", 
    "glass, and the conductor.", 
    "I'd assume now that after the corona discharge, this field", 
    "here is 3 times 10 to the 6.", 
    "Maybe a little lower, but that's the maximum it can be.", 
    "And so the field here in the air will be also 3 times 10 to", 
    "the 6 volts per meter."
