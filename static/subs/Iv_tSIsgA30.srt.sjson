    "WALTER LEWIN: And there is one particular value for Z, and", 
    "therefore for omega, whereby this value reaches a maximum.", 
    "And that's what we call resonance.", 
    "There's no value for omega for which the", 
    "current is any higher.", 
    "And so I will call here the situation at resonance.", 
    "It is at resonance when X equals 0.", 
    "So when omega L is 1 over omega C, so when omega is 1", 
    "over the square root of L C, and we call that", 
    "the resonance frequency.", 
    "And we often give a little subscript 0 there, to remind", 
    "you that you're dealing with the resonance frequency.", 
    "And Z is then just R. Because when X is 0, the omega L and", 
    "the 1 over omega C eat each other up.", 
    "They are not there anymore.", 
    "It's gone.", 
    "And so the system behaves as if there were only a resistor.", 
    "And so you also see that the maximum current that you get", 
    "is then simply V 0 divided by that value for R, because Z,", 
    "the impedance, is now R.", 
    "And in addition, if you're interested in phi, phi", 
    "then becomes 0.", 
    "So the driving voltage is then in phase with the", 
    "current that follows.", 
    "And so the signal that you will see is a cosinusoidal", 
    "variation in the current.", 
    "So if I have here the current as a function of time, then", 
    "you get a signal like so.", 
    "And this here, this period T, equals your 2", 
    "pi divided by omega.", 
    "So that is directly connected to your driving frequency.", 
    "And if the impedance Z is very low then this maximum value of", 
    "the current-- this is what we call the maximum value--", 
    "and of course the maximum value is also here, except", 
    "that the cosine is -1 here and the cosine is +1 here.", 
    "So if Z is very low, then this will be high.", 
    "If Z is very high, this will be low.", 
    "And there is only one and one value of Z for which the", 
    "system is at resonance.", 
    "And that is when the self-inductance and the", 
    "capacitor eat each other up.", 
    "And then you get the maximum possible value for the current", 
    "at maximum, which is V 0 over R. And that's the highest", 
    "value that you could ever get them.", 
    "Imagine that we have an LRC circuit, and we have L and R", 
    "and C fixed, but we changed the driving frequency.", 
    "So we move over various values of Z by changing omega from a", 
    "very low value to a very high value.", 
    "If you start at a very low value for omega, let's say it", 
    "approaches 0, then notice that Z goes to infinity, and so the", 
    "maximum current become 0.", 
    "And the person responsible for that is the capacitor, because", 
    "if omega goes to 0, this goes to infinity.", 
    "And that's intuitively pleasing, because omega 0", 
    "really means you have no AC anymore.", 
    "You have DC.", 
    "And with DC, what you're doing is you're charging up the", 
    "capacitor when it's fully charged.", 
    "No current can flow anymore.", 
    "So that's intuitively pleasing.", 
    "When omega becomes very high, let's call it infinity, then Z", 
    "again goes to infinity.", 
    "So again, the maximum current again goes to 0.", 
    "And the person responsible for that is the self-inductor.", 
    "Because when omega goes to infinity,", 
    "again, Z goes to infinity.", 
    "So again, you get 0 here.", 
    "And that's also intuitively pleasing, because if you have", 
    "an infinitely high frequency that means the self-inductance", 
    "puts up an enormous fight.", 
    "It's ideal for self-inductor to fight currents if the time", 
    "over which the changes occur go to 0.", 
    "And so then again, it says, sorry, you", 
    "can't have any current.", 
    "So that's also intuitively pleasing, that the", 
    "self-inductance then becomes the dominant factor.", 
    "And so what I could do now, I can plot the I max as a", 
    "function of omega.", 
    "So here is omega, and here is I max.", 
    "And we already agreed that when omega is 0", 
    "then I max is 0.", 
    "But when omega is very high, it's also 0.", 
    "But when omega is at resonance, omega 0, which is 1", 
    "over the square root of LC, notice that R has nothing to", 
    "do with the resonance frequency.", 
    "It's really determined by L and C. Because it's the chi,", 
    "it's the X that you want to make 0.", 
    "And X is only a function of L and C.", 
    "At this frequency we have a value here, which is V 0", 
    "divided by R. And so the curve that you're going to see,", 
    "which we call the resonance curve, is something like this.", 
    "You start out with an extremely small current, you", 
    "go through resonance, we have a high current, and then at", 
    "high frequencies, again, you go down to 0.", 
    "And so the left part, when you are below resonance, is really", 
    "the capacitance, which is the dominant guy", 
    "in the whole game.", 
    "And phi, by the way, is here less than 0.", 
    "Here it is the inductor that plays the key role.", 
    "And here, phi equals larger than 0.", 
    "And right here, phi, and only there, phi is 0, only when", 
    "you're exactly at resonance.", 
    "I'd like to show you some numerical results.", 
    "And for that, I have a transparency.", 
    "It's also on the web, so you don't", 
    "have to copy the numbers.", 
    "You can download them.", 
    "They are just some numerical numbers which I want to digest", 
    "with you, so that you get a feeling for the effect, that", 
    "you see it in front of you own eyes what is happening, how", 
    "this curve evolves.", 
    "We have here a given R, L, and C. 10, 5 times 10 to the -2", 
    "Henry, and 3 times 10 to the -7 farads.", 
    "The resonance frequency is a little over", 
    "8,000 radians per second.", 
    "You see it here in kiloHertz, and you", 
    "see here the impedance.", 
    "And what I do here, I have a driving frequency which is 10%", 
    "below the resonance frequency.", 
    "And I calculate for you here omega L, which is 367 ohms and", 
    "1 over omega C, which is 453 ohms.", 
    "You are a little bit below resonance, and so C dominates.", 
    "And you can see, indeed, that this ohm value is", 
    "larger than this one.", 
    "And so out of that pops a value for X, out of that pops", 
    "a value for Z. Notice that X is 86, and Z is only a hair", 
    "larger than 86, because this R almost doesn't add to Z,", 
    "because you get here the square root of 10 squared plus", 
    "86 squared.", 
    "That is almost 86.", 
    "It becomes 87.", 
    "And then you see that the current, the maximum current,", 
    "which is this value for V 0 divided by the Z, by 87,", 
    "becomes 0.11 amperes.", 
    "And now this system is driven at resonance.", 
    "And notice that it's exactly characteristic for resonance", 
    "that omega L and 1 over omega C have the same value.", 
    "They are not there anymore.", 
    "They're gone.", 
    "And so X becomes 0, so the impedance becomes 10 ohms,", 
    "which is the resistance.", 
    "And so the maximum current is now V 0 divided by", 
    "R, which is 1 amperes.", 
    "And when you're 10% over resonance, then the", 
    "self-inductor begins to be more powerful than the", 
    "capacitor, and again your current is substantially down,", 
    "in this case eight times lower than at resonance."
