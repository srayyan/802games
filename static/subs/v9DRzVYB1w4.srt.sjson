    "WALTER LEWIN: So I could calculate, for a specific", 
    "galaxy that I have in mind, I could calculate the distance", 
    "if I know the red shift.", 
    "I have a particular galaxy in mind for which lambda prime is", 
    "1.0033 times lambda.", 
    "So notice again that the wavelength that I receive is", 
    "indeed longer than lambda, so there is a red shift.", 
    "I go to my Doppler Shift Equation, which is this one.", 
    "I calculate beta.", 
    "One equation with one unknown can solve for beta.", 
    "And I find now that v is 5,000 kilometers per second.", 
    "Very straightforward, nothing special, very easy", 
    "calculation.", 
    "But now with Hubble's Law, I can calculate what d is,", 
    "because d now is the velocity, which is 5,000 kilometers per", 
    "second divided by that 72, and that, then, is approximately", 
    "69 megaparsec.", 
    "Again, we have the distance, if we do it in these units, in", 
    "megaparsecs.", 
    "That's about 225 million light years.", 
    "And so the object is about 225 million light", 
    "years away from us.", 
    "So it took the light 225 million years to reach us.", 
    "So when you see light from this object, you're looking", 
    "back in time.", 
    "And if you have a galaxy which is twice as far away as this", 
    "one, then the velocity would be twice as high.", 
    "And they're always receding relative to us.", 
    "I'd like to show you now some spectra of three galaxies.", 
    "Can I have the first slide, John?", 
    "All right.", 
    "You see here a galaxy, and here, you see the spectrum of", 
    "that galaxy.", 
    "That may not be very impressive to you.", 
    "The lines that have been recognized to be due to", 
    "calcium K and calcium H are these two dark lines.", 
    "Some of you may not even be able to see them.", 
    "And this is the comparison spectra taken in the", 
    "laboratory.", 
    "These lines are seen as dark lines, not as bright lines.", 
    "We call them absorption lines.", 
    "They are formed in the atmosphere of the star.", 
    "Why they show up as dark lines and not as bright lines is not", 
    "important now.", 
    "I don't want to go into that.", 
    "That's too much astronomy.", 
    "But they are lines, and that's what counts.", 
    "And these lines are shifted towards the red part of the", 
    "spectrum by a teeny weeny little bit, you see here this", 
    "little arrow.", 
    "And the conclusion, then, is that in this case, the", 
    "velocity of that galaxy is 720 miles per second, which", 
    "translates into 1,150 kilometers per second.", 
    "And so that brings this object-- if you believe the", 
    "modern value for Hubble constant--", 
    "at about 16 megaparsec.", 
    "This galaxy is substantially farther away.", 
    "No surprise that it therefore also looks smaller in size,", 
    "and notice that here, these lines have shifted", 
    "substantially further.", 
    "And if I did my homework, using the velocity that they", 
    "claim, which they can do with high degree of accuracy", 
    "because you can calculate lambda", 
    "prime divided by lambda--", 
    "those measurements can be made with enormous accuracy.", 
    "I find that this object is about 305 megaparsecs away", 
    "from us, so it's about 20 times further", 
    "away than this object.", 
    "So the speed is also about 20 times higher, of course,", 
    "because it's a linear relationship.", 
    "And if you look at this one, which is even further away,", 
    "you'll notice that these lines have shifted even more.", 
    "The next slide shows you what I would call Hubble diagram.", 
    "It was kindly sent to me by Wendy", 
    "Freedman and their coworkers.", 
    "Wendy is the leader of a large team of scientists who are", 
    "making observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.", 
    "You see here distance, and you see here velocity in the units", 
    "that we use in class, kilometers per second.", 
    "Forget this part.", 
    "That's not so important.", 
    "But you see the incredible linear relationship, and Wendy", 
    "concluded that Hubble's constant is around 72.", 
    "It could be a little lower, could be a little higher.", 
    "She goes out all the way to 400 megaparsecs, with", 
    "associated velocities of about 26,000 kilometers per second.", 
    "That's about 9% of the speed of light.", 
    "So beta is about 1/10.", 
    "So for this object, lambda prime divided by lambda would", 
    "be about 1.1.", 
    "There's a 10% shift in the wavelength.", 
    "Hubble, who published his data in the '20s, his whole data", 
    "set when he concluded that there was a linear relation", 
    "had only objects with velocities less than 1,100", 
    "kilometers per second.", 
    "And 1,100 kilometers per second is this point here.", 
    "So Hubble had only points--", 
    "there are not even any in Wendy's diagram--", 
    "which are here.", 
    "And he concluded courageously that there was this linear", 
    "relationship.", 
    "And you see, it has stood the acid test.", 
    "We still believe it is linear.", 
    "The only difference was that Hubble's distances were very", 
    "different from what we believe today.", 
    "They were about seven times smaller.", 
    "So Hubble constant was different for him, but the", 
    "linear relationship was there.", 
    "OK, that's enough for this slide.", 
    "So now comes a $64 question.", 
    "Why do all galaxies which are far way, why do they", 
    "move away from us?", 
    "Well, I can suggest a very simple picture to you.", 
    "We are at the center of the universe, and there was a huge", 
    "explosion a long time ago.", 
    "We refer to that explosion as the Big Bang.", 
    "And since we are at the center where the explosion occurred,", 
    "the galaxies which obtained the largest speed in the", 
    "explosion are now the farthest away from us.", 
    "Now, assume that this explosion is the correct idea.", 
    "Assume that there was a big bang.", 
    "Then I can ask the question, when did it occur?", 
    "I can now turn the clock back, and I can do the following.", 
    "I can take two objects, which are distance, d, apart today,", 
    "but they were together when the universe was", 
    "born at the Big Bang.", 
    "And let's assume that they have been going away from each", 
    "other always with the same velocity.", 
    "Let's assume that now for simplicity.", 
    "If they always went away with the same velocity from each", 
    "other, then the distance that they are now today is their", 
    "velocity times the time, t, which is then", 
    "the age of the universe.", 
    "But we also know it's Hubble's Law that the velocity,", 
    "v, is H times d.", 
    "We assume that these velocities are the same now", 
    "for simplicity.", 
    "You multiply these two equations with each other, and", 
    "you find immediately that the age of the universe is 1 over", 
    "H. And that indeed has the unit of time.", 
    "If you take H--", 
    "the one that we believe in nowadays--", 
    "and you calculate 1 over H, and you work in MKS units,", 
    "you'll find that H is about 14 billion years.", 
    "I'll first give it to you in seconds.", 
    "It's about 4.3 times 10 to the 17 seconds, and that is about", 
    "14 billion years.", 
    "So with this picture in mind, the universe would be about 14", 
    "billion years old.", 
    "But because of the gravitational attraction of", 
    "these galaxies--", 
    "they attract each other--", 
    "you may expect that the speed of the galaxies was larger in", 
    "the past, and therefore we assume that the speed doesn't", 
    "change is not quite accurate.", 
    "And so maybe the universe is a little younger, maybe 12", 
    "billion years or so.", 
    "We know from theoretical calculations that the oldest", 
    "stars in our own galaxy are about 10 billion years old.", 
    "Therefore, the universe cannot be younger", 
    "than 10 billion years.", 
    "And there is general consensus in the community that our", 
    "universe is probably 12 to 14 billion years old.", 
    "Now, the whole issue of these decelerations that I mentioned", 
    "as the galaxies moved away from each other is at the", 
    "heart of research in cosmology.", 
    "And in fact, it is now believed that very early on in", 
    "the universe, there was first acceleration, followed by", 
    "deceleration, and maybe again acceleration.", 
    "That is quite mysterious.", 
    "Frontier research is going on in this area.", 
    "At MIT, we have three world experts.", 
    "Professor Alan Guth has made major contributions to this", 
    "concept, cosmology.", 
    "We have Max Tegmark, and we have Scott Hughes.", 
    "So now comes a reasonable question.", 
    "How far have we been able to see into the universe?", 
    "To my knowledge, this year, which means in 2002, the", 
    "record holder is a galaxy for which lambda prime", 
    "over lambda is 7.56.", 
    "It was published only two months ago.", 
    "7.56.", 
    "Now, at such very large values of red shift, general", 
    "relativity becomes very important.", 
    "And the equation that we derived here was derived for", 
    "special relativity.", 
    "So with very high values of red shift, like lambda prime", 
    "over lambda 7.56, you cannot reliably calculate the", 
    "velocities using that equation.", 
    "And so you cannot use that velocity then and shove it", 
    "into Hubble's law and find the distance.", 
    "But there's no question that that object emitted the light", 
    "that we see now about 13 billion years ago.", 
    "It's very, very far away from us.", 
    "I will show you an object, it comes up in the next slide.", 
    "The light that we see now was emitted about 12", 
    "billion years ago.", 
    "So for one, when you look at that object, there it is.", 
    "Doesn't look very impressive.", 
    "But what do you expect from an object so far away?", 
    "It's a quasar, which is a very peculiar galaxy.", 
    "It emits emission lines.", 
    "The spectra do not show these dark lines that I showed you", 
    "earlier, but they actually have emission lines.", 
    "And the light that you see here was emitted some 12", 
    "billion years ago.", 
    "And now comes the spectrum from this", 
    "object in the next slide.", 
    "This was published last year by Scott Anderson and his", 
    "coworkers, University of Washington in Seattle.", 
    "I have collaborated with Scott on many projects.", 
    "So here, you see the spectrum of that quasar that you just", 
    "saw, and here, you see a line, an emission line, at roughly", 
    "7,800 angstroms.", 
    "And there are all reasons to believe that this, in the", 
    "frame of reference of that quasar, was the Lyman alpha", 
    "line which is emitted by hydrogen,", 
    "which is 1,260 angstroms.", 
    "Now, we have here 5,000, 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, 1,000.", 
    "So here is roughly where the wavelength lambda is, and here", 
    "is lambda prime.", 
    "Lambda prime is 6.41 times larger than lambda.", 
    "He mentions 5.41, but z is what astronomers in general", 
    "quote is lambda prime divided by lambda minus 1.", 
    "So the ratio, lambda prime over lambda, is 6.41.", 
    "Absolutely amazing that you can make such accurate", 
    "measurements, such incredible, beautiful data.", 
    "And this line is all the way in the infrared.", 
    "You cannot see this with your naked eye anymore.", 
    "You can see up to about 7,000 angstroms.", 
    "So the 1,216 line was in the UV, shifts all the way into", 
    "the infrared, and this allows astronomers then to measure", 
    "the value lambda prime over lambda.", 
    "Galaxies that we see now, those that emitted their light", 
    "about 12 to 13 billion years ago are now at a distance from", 
    "us which is about twice as far away as 12 to 13", 
    "billion light years.", 
    "Thus, they are at about 25 billion light years away.", 
    "That's the result of the expansion of the universe.", 
    "Yet the age of our universe is very close to 1 divided by the", 
    "Hubble constant, which is about 14 billion years.", 
    "I calculated that by assuming for simplicity that the", 
    "expansion of the universe was constant in time.", 
    "The reason why the 14 billion years is still quite accurate", 
    "is an accident.", 
    "It turns out that the acceleration and the", 
    "deceleration of space approximately", 
    "cancel each other out.", 
    "The horizon of our universe is at an even larger distance", 
    "than 25 billion light years.", 
    "It's about 45 billion light years.", 
    "Beyond that distance, radiation hasn't had", 
    "time to reach us.", 
    "That's enough John, thank you.", 
    "I'd like to return to the Big Bang, to the explosion some 12", 
    "or 15 billion years ago.", 
    "And I'd like to raise the question, are we at the center", 
    "of that explosion?", 
    "Are we really at the center of our universe?", 
    "That cannot be, of course.", 
    "It's an incredible arrogance.", 
    "It would be too egocentric.", 
    "I know that we all think very highly of ourselves,", 
    "but this cannot be.", 
    "We are nothing in the framework", 
    "of the total universe.", 
    "We cannot possibly be at the center.", 
    "So how do we reconcile this, now, with what we observe?", 
    "Imagine that you were a raisin in a raisin bread.", 
    "Quite a promotion from a human being to a", 
    "raisin in a raisin bread.", 
    "And I put you in an oven.", 
    "And the raisin bread, the dough is going to expand.", 
    "All raisins will see other raisins move away from each", 
    "other, and the larger the distance to your raisins, the", 
    "larger the speed will be.", 
    "And each raisin will think that they are very special.", 
    "Suppose here, this is you, one raisin, and here is another", 
    "raisin, and here is another raisin.", 
    "After a certain amount of time, all", 
    "distances have doubled.", 
    "So this one is here, and this one is here.", 
    "So you can immediately see that when you look at this", 
    "one, that its velocity substantially", 
    "lower than this one.", 
    "If it's twice as far away, you will see", 
    "twice as high a speed.", 
    "But this raisin will look at this one, and it will also", 
    "conclude that this raisin relative to this one has a", 
    "higher velocity then this raisin has", 
    "relative to this one.", 
    "So all of them will think that they are special.", 
    "And you, as a raisin, would come up with Hubble's Law.", 
    "You would conclude that the velocity of your other raisins", 
    "are linearly proportional to the distance.", 
    "There's an analogy which is even nicer than raisin bread,", 
    "and that analogy is with flatlanders.", 
    "A flatlander is someone who lives on a", 
    "two dimensional world.", 
    "He happens to live on the surface of a balloon, and", 
    "light travels only along the surface of the balloon.", 
    "So the two dimensional world is curved in a third dimension", 
    "but the flatlanders cannot see in the third dimension.", 
    "They can only see the second dimension.", 
    "So here you have such a world.", 
    "So here are the galaxies.", 
    "Flat world, and the universe is curved in the third", 
    "dimension, which these flatlanders cannot see.", 
    "And when you blow this balloon up, the galaxies move away", 
    "from each other, and the farther the galaxies are away", 
    "from each other, the higher the velocity.", 
    "This model works actually quite well, and I want to", 
    "pursue that in my next calculation.", 
    "Let me first try to bring this universe to a halt, because I", 
    "don't want the universe to collapse again.", 
    "OK, I succeeded.", 
    "So you can pursue this idea very nicely, and you can see", 
    "that the flatlanders will draw quite amazing conclusions.", 
    "Here is that balloon.", 
    "The balloon has a radius, R. Here is one galaxy and here is", 
    "another galaxy, and they are a distance, S, apart.", 
    "I will call that later d, but now I want to call it s.", 
    "You will see why.", 
    "A little later in time, the universe has expanded.", 
    "This galaxy is here, and this galaxy is here.", 
    "And this distance now is R plus dR, and so this distance", 
    "now between the two galaxies is S plus dS.", 
    "And it follows immediately from the geometry that S plus", 
    "dS divided by S is R plus dR divided by R. Simple high", 
    "school geometry.", 
    "I can work this out.", 
    "I get SR plus RdS is SR plus SdR.", 
    "I lose this SR, I divide by dt.", 
    "dS/dt is the velocity with which these two galaxies move", 
    "away from each other.", 
    "That's what they would measure in their universe.", 
    "So there is a v here.", 
    "It's clear that s is the distance between them.", 
    "I will call that d again, now.", 
    "So that is d.", 
    "And then I have 1 over R times dR/dt.", 
    "1 over R. I will write this a little higher.", 
    "So now, I have 1 over R, dR/dt .", 
    "And look at this.", 
    "I have v equals d times something, and that something", 
    "at a given moment in time has a unique value.", 
    "R of the balloon has a unique value, And dR/dt, which is the", 
    "expansion velocity, also has a unique value.", 
    "And so it's immediately obvious that in this universe,", 
    "this is Hubble's constant, and as Hubble's constant is a", 
    "function of time.", 
    "It is changing with time.", 
    "And it's obvious that it should change in time.", 
    "No reason why it shouldn't do the same in our own universe,", 
    "because R in the past was much smaller.", 
    "So even if you take an expansion velocity which is", 
    "constant, if R is smaller in the past, then H was", 
    "larger in the past.", 
    "And that is the reason why if you ever see a quote of H to", 
    "be 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec, there's always", 
    "a little 0 here, and the 0 means now.", 
    "The 0 means not a billion years from now, and not a", 
    "billion years ago.", 
    "We really don't know what it was a billion years ago.", 
    "Now, don't carry this analogy between the 2D balloon and our", 
    "own universe too far, but it gives", 
    "some interesting insights.", 
    "It is suggestive of the idea that our own three dimensional", 
    "space may be curved in the fourth dimension that we", 
    "cannot see.", 
    "This is very fascinating, and I would advise you, if you are", 
    "interested in this area, that you", 
    "take a course in cosmology.", 
    "You should also take one in general relativity.", 
    "It will open a whole new world for you.", 
    "And Alan Guth, Scott Hughes, and Max Tegmark are the", 
    "experts in this area, and they also happen to", 
    "be very good teachers.", 
    "So you can't lose there.", 
    "Now comes the key question and that is, will our universe", 
    "expand forever?", 
    "It's also possible that our universe will come to a halt.", 
    "That means that H, Hubble's constant, will become 0, that", 
    "everything will stand still, no relative motion anymore,", 
    "which then will be followed by collapse.", 
    "And so all the red shifts will then come to 0 and will turn", 
    "to blue shifts.", 
    "It's the same idea, same question, when you throw up an", 
    "apple, will the apple come back or will the", 
    "apple not come back?", 
    "It depends on the speed of the apple and on the gravitational", 
    "field of the earth, and we all know that if you throw it fast", 
    "enough, about 11 kilometers per second in the absence of", 
    "atmosphere, the apple would never come back.", 
    "Now, if only gravity played the key role in our universe,", 
    "then we can do a very simple calculation.", 
    "The answer to the question whether our universe will", 
    "expand forever or whether it will collapse would then only", 
    "depend on the average density of the universe.", 
    "And when I say average density, then you have to", 
    "think in terms of a big scale.", 
    "You don't think in terms of Cambridge.", 
    "That's not representative for the average density of the", 
    "universe, nor is our solar system, nor is our galaxy.", 
    "But you have to think probably on the scale of a few hundred", 
    "million parsecs, maybe 500 megaparsecs.", 
    "And so I bring you out now into the universe.", 
    "Here is the universe, and these are galaxies, and here", 
    "is a sphere that has a radius, R, and that's on a scale of", 
    "about 500 megaparsecs.", 
    "So Rho, the average density, is", 
    "representative for the universe.", 
    "And let's suppose you were here, or I can take any part", 
    "of the universe.", 
    "There's nothing special about it.", 
    "And you see here a galaxy, and that galaxy moves away from", 
    "you with the velocity, v. That galaxy has a mass, little m.", 
    "The mass inside here, capital M, inside the sphere, is 4/3", 
    "pi R cubed times rho.", 
    "It's the average density, right?", 
    "Now, we know from Newton that the force that this galaxy", 
    "will experience is only determined by the mass inside", 
    "this sphere, and not by the mass outside this sphere.", 
    "And so if I want to calculate whether these two objects will", 
    "forever move away from each other or whether they will", 
    "fall back to each other, then all I have to make sure that I", 
    "make the total energy 0.", 
    "The sum of the kinetic energy and the potential", 
    "energy must be 0.", 
    "So 1/2 m v squared of this object must be mMG divided by", 
    "R. That is when the total energy is 0.", 
    "We will expand forever and ever and ever, and it will", 
    "never come back.", 
    "Little m cancels out.", 
    "Capital M, I can write 4/3 pi R cubed rho.", 
    "Here comes my G, and here comes R.", 
    "Notice that R cubed upstairs becomes R squared.", 
    "And so if I have an R squared here and I have a v squared", 
    "here, remember that v divided by R,", 
    "that is Hubble's constant.", 
    "Because R is d, it's the distance", 
    "between us and the galaxy.", 
    "And so v squared divided by R squared is the Hubble constant", 
    "as we measure it today, squared.", 
    "And so you'll find then, from this simple result, that rho", 
    "as it should be today--", 
    "that's why I put a little 0 there--", 
    "is 3 divided by 8 pi, I get a G there, and I get H0 squared."
