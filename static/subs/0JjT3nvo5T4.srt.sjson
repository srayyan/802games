    "WALTER LEWIN: And if we here have the radius and we here", 
    "have the voltage, and if the radius of the sphere were 3", 
    "millimeters, then you could not exceed a", 
    "voltage of 10 kilovolts.", 
    "If you did, you would get this automatic electric breakdown.", 
    "You would get a spark.", 
    "If you have a sphere of 3 centimeters, that would be 100", 
    "kilovolts, and our Van de Graaff which has a radius of", 
    "30 centimeters, would therefore be 1 million volts,", 
    "and you could not exceed that.", 
    "And in practice, in fact, this one doesn't even make it to 1", 
    "million volts.", 
    "The sphere is not perfect.", 
    "There are imperfections of the sphere.", 
    "There are areas which have, so to speak, sharp points.", 
    "And so we won't make it to 1 million volts.", 
    "We get a breakdown, maybe at a few 100,000,", 
    "maybe 300,000 volts.", 
    "You can now also calculate what the maximum charge is on", 
    "the Van de Graaff, because if the maximum potential is", 
    "300,000 volts, you know the radius is 0.3 meters, so you", 
    "can calculate now what the maximum charge is that you can", 
    "put on the Van de Graaff.", 
    "Using that equation, it will give you 10 microcoulombs.", 
    "And so the maximum potential for our Van de Graaff is of", 
    "the order of 300,000 volts.", 
    "So this gives you now a qualitative feeling for", 
    "numbers, for what the--", 
    "can I put this down?", 
    "-- so this gives you an idea of what our Van", 
    "de Graaff can do.", 
    "And later, we will understand how the charge gets there.", 
    "But at least you have some feeling now for potentials and", 
    "for the charges that are involved.", 
    "If here is my Van de Graaff, and I approach the Van de", 
    "Graaff with a sphere which is connected to the earth, and if", 
    "this Van de Graaff has positive charge on it, then", 
    "this sphere will become negatively", 
    "charged through induction.", 
    "And so you get field lines, which go from the Van de", 
    "Graaff to this object, always perpendicular to the", 
    "equipotentials.", 
    "So they go like this.", 
    "And so the electric field here will", 
    "probably be the strongest.", 
    "And so the spark will then develop between this sphere", 
    "and the Van de Graaff, provided that you were close", 
    "enough so that you do achieve an electric field close to", 
    "this sphere of about 3 million volts per meter.", 
    "And I will show you that later.", 
    "You will see more sparks today than you've ever seen before", 
    "in your life.", 
    "But I want you to appreciate a little bit more about the", 
    "sparks before I demonstrate that so you get a little bit", 
    "more out of it.", 
    "If I approach the Van de Graaff, not with the sphere,", 
    "but I would walk to the Van de Graaff, being very courageous", 
    "like this--", 
    "I am also a pretty good conductor, I am also connected", 
    "with the earth--", 
    "then the chances are that the spark would develop first", 
    "between my nose and the Van de Graaff, because that is the", 
    "sharpest curvature, the smallest radius.", 
    "Or certainly my head would be a good candidate", 
    "for being hit first.", 
    "If I approach the Van de Graaff like this with my hands", 
    "stretched, then chances are, of course, that the sparks", 
    "will first develop between my fingertips.", 
    "Of course, it's a very small radius, and they're very close", 
    "to the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And so that's where the discharge will occur.", 
    "And so before we will enjoy some of this--", 
    "you will enjoy it.", 
    "I will enjoy it less.", 
    "I want to talk a little about lightning with you first.", 
    "There are 400,000 thunderstorms every day on", 
    "average on Earth--", 
    "400,000 thunderstorms.", 
    "There are about 100 lightning flashes every second.", 
    "In general, the top of a thunder cloud becomes positive", 
    "and the bottom becomes negative.", 
    "The physics of that is not so easy and probably incomplete.", 
    "And I will not go into the details of the physics.", 
    "But it does have to do with the flow of water drops.", 
    "They become elongated.", 
    "They can become charged because of friction.", 
    "And they can break off and they can transport charge.", 
    "I will simply give you some facts.", 
    "And so I will accept the fact that the cloud", 
    "is going to be charged.", 
    "This is the cloud--", 
    "positive at the top, negative at the bottom.", 
    "And here is the Earth.", 
    "Because of induction, the Earth, of course, will", 
    "therefore become positively charged here.", 
    "And so we're going to see electric field lines which go", 
    "from the Earth to the cloud, always perpendicular to the", 
    "equipotentials--", 
    "something like this.", 
    "I'll give you some dimensions.", 
    "This may be something like 5 kilometers.", 
    "This vertical distance d is about 1 kilometer.", 
    "These are typical numbers, of course.", 
    "It can vary enormously from thunderstorm to thunderstorm.", 
    "And this height is something typically like 10 kilometers.", 
    "If we oversimplify the situation by assuming that the", 
    "cloud and the ground behave like plane parallel", 
    "conductors, then we can roughly calculate the", 
    "potential difference between the cloud and the ground.", 
    "I will do that first.", 
    "But I warn you in advance that this is not kosher.", 
    "If we make the simplifying assumption that the electric", 
    "field is more or less constant here--", 
    "it's like having two parallel plates where the electric", 
    "field is constant between them--", 
    "then the potential difference, delta V between the bottom of", 
    "the cloud and the Earth is simply the electric field", 
    "times the distance d.", 
    "So this becomes E times d.", 
    "But if the breakdown occurs at 3 million volts per meter--", 
    "so we get 3 times 10 to the 6.", 
    "That is for E. And the distance between the cloud and", 
    "the Earth, let's take 1 kilometer, so", 
    "that's 10 to the 3 meters.", 
    "So we get of the order 3 billion volts between the", 
    "Earth and the cloud.", 
    "But now comes the catch.", 
    "As I was told by Amir Rizk of Lightning Electric", 
    "Technologies, that you cannot extrapolate the values from a", 
    "small uniform field gap between two plates to a", 
    "lightning strike.", 
    "This is because the conditions for the continued propagation", 
    "of an electric discharge are not the same as the conditions", 
    "for its initiation.", 
    "If an electric discharge is spanning a gap that is longer", 
    "than a few meters, a discharge can move in electric fields", 
    "that are orders of magnitude smaller than the electric", 
    "fields that initiated the original electron avalanche.", 
    "At a height of 1 kilometer, that is somewhat lower than 3", 
    "million volts per meter.", 
    "Consequently, the potential difference between the cloud", 
    "and the Earth can vary between 50 million", 
    "and 100 million volts.", 
    "It can even be either positive or negative.", 
    "The details of the physics of the discharge--", 
    "very complicated, but I want to share with you some facts", 
    "without giving detailed explanations.", 
    "The start of the lightning begins when electrons begin to", 
    "flow from the cloud to the Earth.", 
    "They form a funnel, which is about 1 to", 
    "10 meters in diameter.", 
    "And we call that the step leader.", 
    "The step leader moves about 100 miles per second, and so", 
    "it comes down in about 5 milliseconds.", 
    "5 milliseconds from here to here, and it takes about half", 
    "a coulomb to the Earth.", 
    "Half a coulomb for about 5 milliseconds--", 
    "that means the current is about 100 amperes.", 
    "The step leader creates a channel of ionized air-- full", 
    "of ions and full of electrons, which is an", 
    "extremely good conductor.", 
    "And when the step leader reaches the ground, there is", 
    "this highly conductive channel, and the electrons can", 
    "now very quickly flow from this channel to the ground.", 
    "And that starts first right here at the", 
    "surface of the Earth.", 
    "That's where the electrons will first go to the Earth.", 
    "And then successively, electrons which are higher up", 
    "in the channel will make it down to the Earth.", 
    "And so you're going to see electrons going through the", 
    "channel to the Earth.", 
    "But first the electrons are closer to the Earth than the", 
    "electrons farther away, and then even farther away.", 
    "And this is actually where most of the action occurs.", 
    "The current is now enormously high--", 
    "10,000 to some 100,000 amperes.", 
    "And you heat the air, get a tremendous amount of light.", 
    "The ions recombine, and you get pressure.", 
    "Heat produces pressure.", 
    "And there comes your thunder.", 
    "And so most of the action is not in the step leader, but is", 
    "in this second phenomenon, which we call the return", 
    "stroke, which is from the Earth to the cloud.", 
    "And the speed of that return stroke is about 10% to 20% of", 
    "the speed of light.", 
    "During the return stroke, there is about 5 coulomb", 
    "exchange between the cloud and the Earth.", 
    "And 5 Coulomb is a sizable fraction of the total charge", 
    "that was on the cloud to start with.", 
    "After a return stroke--", 
    "maybe 20 milliseconds later--", 
    "this whole process can start again.", 
    "You can get a step leader and you can get the return stroke.", 
    "However, the step leader will now follow exactly the same", 
    "path that was made before, because that's where the air", 
    "is ionized, so that's where the conductivity is very high.", 
    "So that's the easiest way to go.", 
    "And this process can recur 5, 10, maybe 15 times.", 
    "So what appears to you as one lightning bolt, in fact, could", 
    "be 10 flashes back and forth between the", 
    "cloud and the Earth.", 
    "And the real light is not in the step leader.", 
    "That's very little light.", 
    "But the real light is in the return strokes.", 
    "So 10 return strokes, which may be 20, 30, 40 milliseconds", 
    "apart, appear to you and to me only has one flash, which", 
    "would take place maybe in as little as a tenth of a second.", 
    "And during the these 5 or 10 return strokes, you exchange", 
    "between the cloud and the Earth maybe a total of 25 to", 
    "50 coulombs.", 
    "And that of course, will lower the potential difference.", 
    "And if the potential difference becomes too low,", 
    "then the process stops.", 
    "You have to wait now for the cloud to charge up again.", 
    "And then lightning will strike again.", 
    "And that can take anywhere from maybe", 
    "4, 5, 10, 20 seconds.", 
    "And then you get another lightning bolt.", 
    "The study of this process of the step leader and of the", 
    "return stroke can be done with a camera which is called the", 
    "Bors camera.", 
    "Let me first explain to you in detail in", 
    "principle how it works.", 
    "If this is the area on the film that is exposed by your", 
    "lens, suppose that I move the film at a very high speed to", 
    "the left, and suppose the step leader comes down, and I see", 
    "some light from the step leader, then I may see on the", 
    "film this--", 
    "some light.", 
    "And from here to here, would then be the 5 milliseconds", 
    "which it takes the step leader to go from the", 
    "cloud to the Earth.", 
    "Now, the return stroke takes place with a way higher speed.", 
    "And so I see a tremendous amount of light, because", 
    "there's a lot of light in the return stroke.", 
    "And of course this is very steep, because it goes a", 
    "hundred times faster up then the step leader came down.", 
    "And so you can measure these times.", 
    "And so you can get the speed of the return stroke.", 
    "And then later in time-- maybe 30, 40 milliseconds", 
    "later on the film--", 
    "you may see another return stroke.", 
    "And you may see another one.", 
    "And so you can see, then, how long the time was between the", 
    "return strokes.", 
    "And you can also calculate their speeds.", 
    "With a real camera, it's not really the film that is", 
    "moving, but it is the lens that is moving.", 
    "And the way these pictures are taken--", 
    "and I will show you one--", 
    "is if this is the photographic plate, then it is the camera", 
    "that moves over the plate with a very high speed-- about", 
    "3,000 revolutions per minute.", 
    "And so you would get this information, then, not", 
    "horizontally, but you get it spread out over the film.", 
    "But you get the same information.", 
    "You can calculate speeds and times.", 
    "During the past decade, new forms of lightning have been", 
    "discovered, which occur way above the", 
    "clouds, way higher up.", 
    "Red colors have been seen.", 
    "Red sprites they are called, and also blue jets.", 
    "The light is very faint.", 
    "And it occurs only for a very short amount of time.", 
    "It's very difficult to photograph.", 
    "I have not been able to get good slides for today.", 
    "However, I did see some pictures on the web.", 
    "And when you log in to the web, when you visit the web", 
    "8.02, which you should, then I give you directions how to", 
    "access slides, pictures of the red sprites", 
    "and of the blue jets.", 
    "The physics of that is not very well understood.", 
    "It's being researched very heavily.", 
    "But it's way above the cloud.", 
    "There are also other forms of electric", 
    "breakdown, of discharge.", 
    "They are different in the sense that it's not an", 
    "individual spark.", 
    "But there is a continuous flow of charge.", 
    "It occurs always from very sharp points.", 
    "So there's a continuous current actually going on.", 
    "And some of that you may have seen,", 
    "but you may not remember.", 
    "When we use the carbon arc here, we have two carbon arcs,", 
    "two carbon rods, and we had a potential", 
    "difference between them.", 
    "And we got a discharge between them which caused a tremendous", 
    "amount of light, which we used for projection purposes.", 
    "So a carbon arc discharge is such a form of discharge", 
    "whereby you have a continuous current.", 
    "It's not just sparks.", 
    "If you take grass, or trees, or brushes for that matter,", 
    "thunderstorm activity, they can go into this discharge at", 
    "their sharp tips.", 
    "And we call this brush discharge.", 
    "We call it St. Elmo's fire.", 
    "It's all the same thing.", 
    "It's also called corona discharge.", 
    "I normally call it corona discharge.", 
    "It produces light, because the ions, when they neutralize,", 
    "produce light.", 
    "Heat makes sound, pressure.", 
    "And so you can hear this cracking noise of the corona", 
    "discharges.", 
    "An airplane that flies or a car that drives-- there is", 
    "friction with the air.", 
    "And any form of friction can charge things up.", 
    "And so it's not uncommon at night that you can see this", 
    "corona discharge from the tip of the wings of an airplane.", 
    "I've also seen it from cars--", 
    "corona discharge from cars, which charge themselves up", 
    "simply by driving through the air.", 
    "The air flow would charge them up.", 
    "You can hear it cracking.", 
    "And you can see it sometimes.", 
    "If it's dark enough, you see some light.", 
    "In general, it's bluish light.", 
    "Something completely on the side, going back to the", 
    "lightning bolts--", 
    "lightning bolts, the discharge, the moving", 
    "electrons can cause radio waves.", 
    "And these radio waves you can receive on your car radio.", 
    "And all of you have experienced this-- driving", 
    "around, lightning very far away.", 
    "You can hear it on the radio.", 
    "So that's telling you that there is", 
    "lightning going on somewhere.", 
    "After a thunderstorm, something that many of you may", 
    "not have experienced, because in the cities there's always", 
    "exhaust from cars that spoils everything.", 
    "But when you're out in the country, after a thunderstorm,", 
    "there is a very special smell in the air.", 
    "I love it.", 
    "And that's ozone.", 
    "Oxygen 2 in lightning becomes oxygen 3.", 
    "And oxygen 3 has a wonderful smell.", 
    "And you can really smell that.", 
    "It's very typical.", 
    "I hope that most of you, sooner or later in life, will", 
    "have that experience.", 
    "Go to the country after a thunderstorm, and you can", 
    "really smell this ozone.", 
    "Let's now look at some slides.", 
    "The first slides that you will see is one very classic slide", 
    "made by Gary Ladd at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona.", 
    "What I like about this is that these are the observatory's", 
    "telescopes in the domes.", 
    "And of course, if, when you're an astronomer, this is the", 
    "kind of weather that you can do without.", 
    "But nevertheless, it happens.", 
    "You see here return strokes.", 
    "The light is definitely due to the return strokes.", 
    "It's very bright.", 
    "These are step leaders that never made it to the Earth.", 
    "And if a step leader doesn't make it to the Earth, you", 
    "don't get a return stroke, and so the light, as you can see", 
    "here, is much less.", 
    "And what you think here is only 1 volt is probably at", 
    "least 10, 5 to 10, maybe 15 flashes, return strokes.", 
    "All right, next slide, please.", 
    "Here, you see the result of a Bors camera exposure.", 
    "For those of you who are sitting in front, you can", 
    "recognize maybe the Empire State Building here.", 
    "And the Empire State Building is hit here by lightning at", 
    "the lightning rod's sharp point.", 
    "That's where you expect it to be hit.", 
    "This is not taken when the camera was rotating.", 
    "This is just the exposure the way you and I would see it.", 
    "Not moving camera, but here you see the result of the", 
    "rotating Bors camera.", 
    "This is the same flash.", 
    "So here you see the return stroke.", 
    "The light from the step leader is too faint.", 
    "You can't see that.", 
    "So here's the return stroke and then this time separation,", 
    "maybe 30 or 40 milliseconds.", 
    "You see another stroke, you see another", 
    "one, and another one.", 
    "So there's six here.", 
    "Looks like you see a double one here.", 
    "And so we have six or seven of these returns strokes.", 
    "And this is the way that you can study speeds and how much", 
    "charge actually is exchanged between the clouds and, in", 
    "this case, the Empire State Building.", 
    "The next slide shows you a corona discharge in the", 
    "laboratory.", 
    "This is a high voltage supply with a very sharp tip here at", 
    "the end, the sharp point.", 
    "And here, you see not individual sparks.", 
    "You don't call this lightning.", 
    "But this is what you would call the St. Elmo's fire.", 
    "The corona discharge is bluish light.", 
    "And in fact, when you are close to this power supply,", 
    "you can also smell the ozone.", 
    "It also produces locally ozone.", 
    "And you can see it.", 
    "If you make it dark in the laboratory, you can see some", 
    "bluish lights.", 
    "When I was a graduate student, I had to build high voltage", 
    "power supplies.", 
    "And I remember when my soldering job was", 
    "not a very good job.", 
    "That means when I take the solder iron off, then I could", 
    "draw a little sharp point, solder, and that would then", 
    "later cause me problems with corona discharge.", 
    "It means I would have to redo the soldering so that the", 
    "radius of the solder joint would become larger--", 
    "so no sharp points.", 
    "That's enough for the slides right now.", 
    "Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod."
