    "WALTER LEWIN: What does that mean now with respect to any", 
    "charge on the inside surface?", 
    "Now there must be charge on the inside surface because now", 
    "if I make this my Gaussian surface, which is now a", 
    "spherical surface, a closed surface, Mr. Gauss says that", 
    "the closed surface integral of E dot dA over this surface", 
    "must be 0 because the electric field is 0 anywhere.", 
    "That's the same as all the charge inside", 
    "divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "So the charge inside must be 0.", 
    "Since there can be no charge in the conductor itself,", 
    "negative charge must now accumulate on the inside of", 
    "that surface so that the net charge inside", 
    "this surface is 0.", 
    "So now we do get charge on the inside.", 
    "And how much charge do you get on the inside?", 
    "Exactly -q so that the sum of the two is 0.", 
    "Now, this conductor originally was neutral.", 
    "It had no net charge, so therefore on the surface of", 
    "the conductor, we must now see charge plus q, because the", 
    "minus charge on the inside came from the conductor", 
    "itself, and so the sum must be 0.", 
    "So now you get a peculiar situation, that the +q charge", 
    "inside, which creates an E field inside, creates negative", 
    "charge on the inside, the same in magnitude opposite in sign,", 
    "and +q charge on the outside.", 
    "And the electric fields, they are very complicated.", 
    "The electric fields--", 
    "let me try to put them in.", 
    "I would imagine that if this charge q is closer to this", 
    "wall than to this wall, that the negative charge here will", 
    "be larger in density than there.", 
    "It's really an induction effect.", 
    "The negative charge wants to go to this plus.", 
    "That's really what's happening.", 
    "And so since this charge is closer to this wall than to", 
    "that wall, it will be able to attract more electrons.", 
    "And so it's clear that the density of charge here should", 
    "be higher than there, and so the field lines always", 
    "perpendicular to the equipotential, so they must be", 
    "always perpendicular to the wall, sort of like this, so I", 
    "put in a few field lines.", 
    "But here, the fields will be stronger than there.", 
    "So there is a field inside.", 
    "What now is the charge distribution on the outside?", 
    "That is the hardest of all and by no means so obvious.", 
    "It turns out that the charge on the outside on this sphere,", 
    "because it is a sphere, will be uniformly distributed.", 
    "And it is not intuitive, and it is not obvious.", 
    "Nature must obey all laws of physics.", 
    "The conductor must become an equipotential.", 
    "There can be no electric field inside the conductor.", 
    "Electric field lines have to be everywhere perpendicular to", 
    "the surface.", 
    "The closed loop integral of E dot dl must be 0 everywhere.", 
    "And the only way that nature can do that is by making the", 
    "charge distribution on the surface uniform.", 
    "And that is amazing when you think of that.", 
    "It's independent of the position of", 
    "that charge, +q inside.", 
    "So if you start to move around with that charge +q inside,", 
    "the outside world will not know.", 
    "The outside world only knows that there is a charge +q", 
    "uniformly distributed on the outside", 
    "because it is a sphere.", 
    "That would not be the case if it were a heart.", 
    "But the outside world has no way of knowing that you are", 
    "moving that charge inside around.", 
    "So I am sitting inside there, and suppose I crawl inside", 
    "there with a rubber rod and with a cat, and I use the", 
    "rubber rod on the cat, creating positive and negative", 
    "charge-- same amount.", 
    "The outside world will not know because I don't change", 
    "the charge inside.", 
    "I only have this +q in my pocket.", 
    "The fact that I create plus on the cat and maybe minus on", 
    "myself, the outside world will never know because the sum of", 
    "the charges is still q.", 
    "They may hear the cat scream.", 
    "That's all they can hear.", 
    "But they have no way of knowing that I'm fooling", 
    "around there with charges.", 
    "And so the outside world has no way of knowing what happens", 
    "on the inside.", 
    "And we call that electrostatic shielding.", 
    "That's the effect of a Faraday cage.", 
    "I want to demonstrate when I bring this can in", 
    "the electric field.", 
    "It's a conducting, hollow object.", 
    "I bring it in an electric field of the Van de Graaf.", 
    "The thing is a conductor.", 
    "I will show you that because of the induction, you're going", 
    "to get, like you see on that figure, you're going to get", 
    "negative charge on one side, positive charge on the other", 
    "side, and zero charge on the inside.", 
    "That's quite amazing, isn't it?", 
    "If this were positive--", 
    "let's assume it is-- then this side becomes negative, this", 
    "side becomes positive.", 
    "The whole thing is an equipotential--", 
    "no charge inside.", 
    "Quite amazing.", 
    "So let's turn on this Van de Graaf so we create that", 
    "electric field.", 
    "We turn on the electroscope.", 
    "Here is my little ping-pong ball, conducting, and I'm", 
    "going to touch first the can on your left side.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "And I bring this charge on the electroscope.", 
    "Boy, nice charge.", 
    "I now touch the other side.", 
    "And I will approach the--", 
    "I heard a spark-- sparks are always bad.", 
    "I approach that electroscope, and if the reading of the", 
    "electroscope--", 
    "if the deflection becomes less, as we discussed earlier,", 
    "it means that the polarity that I have on here is", 
    "different from the polarity on the electroscope.", 
    "And you clearly see that.", 
    "The deflection becomes less.", 
    "So the charge that I took off from this side has a different", 
    "polarity than the charge that I took on from that side, but", 
    "yet, it's an equipotential.", 
    "All that strange polarization of charges takes", 
    "place at the surface.", 
    "And now I will try to get inside to see whether I can", 
    "get some charge from the inside, and there", 
    "shouldn't be any.", 
    "Ooh, I have to take this charge off, of course.", 
    "And I touch this, and you see no charge.", 
    "So you've seen three things which is quite amazing--", 
    "that the charge on this side has a different polarity from", 
    "the charge on that side and that everything", 
    "happens on the surface.", 
    "Nothing happens on the inside.", 
    "I could not get any charge from the inside.", 
    "Now, we're going to experiment with more dangerous stuff, and", 
    "that is with the Van de Graaf Here you see a Faraday cage", 
    "which has some openings.", 
    "It's not solid conductor, but it has small openings.", 
    "It doesn't change the situation too much,", 
    "maybe only a little.", 
    "And I'm going to go inside that cage.", 
    "This would also be a nice Faraday cage, but it's very", 
    "hard for me to crawl in there.", 
    "And if I go in there with a radio, just like the radio in", 
    "your car, then you may not be able to hear the radio, even", 
    "though radio waves is a difficult story because the", 
    "shielding that we discussed is only electrostatic shielding,", 
    "and radio waves are electromagnetic radiation,", 
    "with strongly changing fields.", 
    "So it may not be as perfect a shielding as you may think.", 
    "But we all know if someone breaks off the antenna of your", 
    "car, which happens in Cambridge all the time, you", 
    "have no reception inside, because your car", 
    "is a Faraday cage.", 
    "And so what I will do, I will go into the cage.", 
    "I will first show you that when we charge that cage, that", 
    "we bring it up to a few 100,000 volts.", 
    "I'll just hold some tinsel in my hand to convince you that,", 
    "yes, indeed, this cage will be charged by the Van de Graaf,", 
    "provided there is contact here, and we'll see that, yes,", 
    "Marcos, give me the full blast.", 
    "But just look at the tinsel.", 
    "And you see this tinsel clearly indicates, like an", 
    "electroscope, that I'm being charged now.", 
    "So I'll jump off.", 
    "If you can discharge, then I will go inside.", 
    "I will have the tinsel with me, so I will show you that", 
    "inside there when they charge that cage, that the tinsels", 
    "will not spread out, and I will bring with me this", 
    "wonderful radio, and--", 
    "SPEAKER 1: --said a woman who opposes embalming is a suspect", 
    "in the murder--", 
    "AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] funeral home--", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: I didn't plan that, believe me.",

    "self-proclaimed prophet, Kathryn Padilla, grandmother", 
    "of 10, denies the charges, and tells a reporter she's not,",

    "SPEAKER 2: She's 55, and she's formed what she calls her own", 
    "[INAUDIBLE]--", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Nothing.", 
    "I'm shielded.", 
    "However, there is a problem.", 
    "You can still hear me, and I'm wearing a transmitter, and the", 
    "receiver is somewhere outside this box, so why can", 
    "you still hear me?", 
    "That means that the kind of radio waves that I am", 
    "transmitting are a very high frequency.", 
    "It's not a static field, so somehow they can get through.", 
    "So the shielding is not perfect for fast changing", 
    "electric fields, but it's good enough for AM radios.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: So now I'll go in, and I'll try to be brave,",
