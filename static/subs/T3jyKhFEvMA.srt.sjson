    "This is the fundamental, 212 Hertz.", 
    "425 Hertz.", 
    "637.", 
    "637.", 
    "STUDENTS: [LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Thank you, thank you, thank you.", 
    "Several years after this lecture, I measured the", 
    "frequencies and discovered that what I believe to be the", 
    "first harmonic in this lecture, in reality, was the", 
    "second harmonic.", 
    "So all resonance frequencies were one harmonic higher than", 
    "I thought at the time.", 
    "If you bang on a tuning fork or you pluck on a string, in", 
    "isolation you hear nothing--", 
    "almost nothing.", 
    "I have here a tuning fork, and if I bang on it, you hear", 
    "nothing and I hear nothing-- almost nothing, unless I hold", 
    "it very close to my ear.", 
    "What we do now with string instruments--", 
    "we mount the strings on a box with air.", 
    "The sound cavity, the sounding board, it's called.", 
    "And now the air inside can oscillate with it.", 
    "It doesn't always have to be precisely at resonance.", 
    "And also the surface itself of the box can start to vibrate.", 
    "So you're displacing more air, and the sound", 
    "becomes loud and clear.", 
    "You don't create energy, but you drain the energy out of", 
    "the oscillating string faster, and so for that short amount", 
    "of time, you get loudest sound.", 
    "And I will demonstrate that first with the tuning fork.", 
    "I hear it now very well.", 
    "It's harder for you, because you're farther away.", 
    "Now you hear nothing.", 
    "And now you hear it.", 
    "It can actually be much better demonstrated with this little", 
    "music box that I bought years ago in Switzerland.", 
    "If I rotate this music box-- it has a very romantic tune--", 
    "you hear nothing.", 
    "I hear a little bit.", 
    "And now I put it on this box.", 
    "Unmistakable.", 
    "So that's the idea of sounding boards.", 
    "You have them on violins, you have them on pianos, and of", 
    "course the design of these sounding boards is top secret.", 
    "The manufacturer is not going to tell you how they built", 
    "them, because the quality of the sound, of course, is", 
    "partly in the design of the sounding board.", 
    "I can make you hear and I can make you see sounds.", 
    "And my goal for the remaining time is to make you see and", 
    "hear at the same time.", 
    "I have here a microphone, which is like your eardrum.", 
    "And suppose I generate 440 Hertz, and I can do that with", 
    "a tuning fork.", 
    "So here is the amplitude of the oscillation of the", 
    "membrane in the microphone--", 
    "which is your eardrum, say.", 
    "We amplify that.", 
    "And we show you on an oscilloscope the current after", 
    "amplification.", 
    "And so you're going to see a signal like this, and if this", 
    "is 440 Hertz.", 
    "So this is time.", 
    "And this is the displacement of your eardrum--", 
    "in our case, it's a microphone.", 
    "It's really a current after amplification.", 
    "And if this is 440 Hertz, then this time T will be about 2.3", 
    "milliseconds--", 
    "1 divided by 440.", 
    "That's no problem for an oscilloscope.", 
    "We can do much better than that.", 
    "So the time resolution is not a problem.", 
    "And so I will show you there the output of our microphone.", 
    "I will show you this signal as a function of time.", 
    "For 440 Hertz, you see a boring signal.", 
    "And I can make a boring signal with a tuning fork.", 
    "That's almost a pure sinusoid.", 
    "But now, it just so happens that today we have in our", 
    "audience someone who can play the violin.", 
    "And that person is going to produce 440 Hertz.", 
    "But at the same time, he's going to produce a second", 
    "harmonic, and maybe a third harmonic, and", 
    "maybe a fourth harmonic.", 
    "And so imagine, now, that simultaneously, your eardrum", 
    "is going to do this.", 
    "But at the same time, your eardrum is going to do this", 
    "because this is some higher harmonic.", 
    "Then the net result is that your eardrum", 
    "is going to do this.", 
    "And that is what I'm going to show you.", 
    "And so when you see the various instruments, you will", 
    "recognize that on top of the fundamental, you will see", 
    "these very characteristic harmonics--", 
    "each instrument having its own unique cocktail.", 
    "And when you hear that cocktail, you say, oh, yeah.", 
    "That's a saxophone.", 
    "Or you say, oh, that's a violin.", 
    "You would never mistake a saxophone for a violin, and", 
    "that's because of the combination", 
    "of the higher harmonics.", 
    "And so we are so fortunate that we have four musicians in", 
    "our audience.", 
    "Tom, who is the violinist.", 
    "Where is Tom?", 
    "There is Tom.", 
    "I hope you brought your violin.", 
    "Oh, you've got it there.", 
    "And then we have Emily--", 
    "I saw her already--", 
    "as the clarinet.", 
    "If you come this way, Emily.", 
    "And we have Aaron.", 
    "Aaron has a bassoon.", 
    "You may never have seen a bassoon.", 
    "A bassoon is an instrument that produces a very low tone.", 
    "So the instrument is going to be very big--", 
    "bigger than Aaron.", 
    "Just wait and see.", 
    "It's a beauty.", 
    "It's a really beautiful instrument.", 
    "A flute is only this big.", 
    "Oh, look at that--", 
    "a beautiful big bassoon.", 
    "And then we have Fabian, who is a saxophone.", 
    "So if you stand here, then I will first do the boring part.", 
    "And what I will do is I will show you, then, what a", 
    "440-Hertz signal looks like produced with a tuning fork,", 
    "and we'll see it there, and so I have to change the light", 
    "situation substantially, so the musicians will get a", 
    "little bit into the dark, but you will still", 
    "be able to see them.", 
    "And so I'm going to turn on now the microphone.", 
    "And that's where you're going to see the signal.", 
    "And when you make noise, you can hear and see yourself.", 
    "440.", 
    "Boring and no signs of higher harmonics.", 
    "Now, Tom will try to produce 440 on his violin, or close to", 
    "440, and then look for the higher harmonics which make", 
    "the violin characteristic.", 
    "Notice that the average spacing, the repetition, is", 
    "indeed the same as it was with the 440, but you saw this", 
    "incredible richness of harmonics.", 
    "Tom happens to be, also, an excellent violin player, and", 
    "so he insisted that he demonstrate that.", 
    "All right, Tom?", 
    "TOM: All right.", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: OK.", 
    "Go ahead.", 
    "Terrific.", 
    "Emily, would your mind producing something that comes", 
    "close to 440 Hertz?", 
    "Come a little close to the microphone.", 
    "Notice the big difference with the violin.", 
    "Violin, many, many higher harmonics.", 
    "Her instrument, maybe only one, maybe only the", 
    "fundamental and the second harmonic.", 
    "Can you try again?", 
    "Now we have noise.", 
    "Now, Emily did not insist that she wanted to play, but I did.", 
    "So Emily, would you please?", 
    "Impressive.", 
    "Aaron, with his bassoon.", 
    "He ordered a special chair.", 
    "Because he says, look, it was an instrument so big, and L is", 
    "so large, it's heavy.", 
    "Clearly, a bass, which produces low frequencies is", 
    "heavier than a violin, and the same is true with woodwind", 
    "instruments.", 
    "Aaron, could you try something close to 440?", 
    "Bizarre instrument, isn't it?", 
    "It's really a combination of probably fundamental and", 
    "second harmonic.", 
    "Aaron, would you mind showing some of your expertise?", 
    "This is a wonderful instrument.", 
    "You don't see them too often, do you?", 
    "Terrific.", 
    "And last but not least, we have a saxophone.", 
    "Fabian.", 
    "Now, you may have to stand a long distance from this", 
    "microphone, because these instruments make a hell of a", 
    "lot of noise, don't they?", 
    "So give it a shot, and try 440 or come close to that.", 
    "It doesn't have to be exact.", 
    "Interesting.", 
    "Also, you see several higher harmonics.", 
    "It's hard to tell which.", 
    "Would you mind playing something real hot?", 
    "Oh, man, man, man.", 
    "Come on.", 
    "Come on, here.", 
    "If you think we're interested in hearing it, you're wrong.", 
    "We want to see it.", 
    "Oh, hell.", 
    "I missed it!", 
    "Do it again.", 
    "STUDENTS: [LAUGHING]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: Do it again.", 
    "I missed it.", 
    "You can, you can.", 
    "Thank all of you.", 
    "Thank you very much.", 
    "So during the last three minutes, I would like to", 
    "discuss with you the speed of sound in a", 
    "little bit more detail.", 
    "You notice that the speed of sound is proportional with the", 
    "temperature and the molecular weight.", 
    "In fact, there are a few other things upstairs here, but", 
    "these are the major contributors.", 
    "So I should really say it's proportional.", 
    "If you take air, as we discussed earlier, molecular", 
    "weight is 30.", 
    "That's a God-given--", 
    "there's not much you can do about it.", 
    "I would like to demonstrate to you the dependence on", 
    "molecular weight.", 
    "And one way I could do that--", 
    "I could take all the air out of 26-100 and", 
    "replace it with helium.", 
    "And then I would ask the same musicians to come and I would", 
    "ask them then to play their wind instruments.", 
    "The L's are fixed.", 
    "There's nothing you can do about it.", 
    "So the instruments don't know that I put helium in the", 
    "audience, so the only thing that changes is V. The speed", 
    "will go up by almost a factor of 3, and so the fundamentals", 
    "would be three times higher and the harmonics would be", 
    "three times higher.", 
    "So you would hear much higher frequencies and you wouldn't", 
    "even recognize these instruments.", 
    "This wouldn't be very practical.", 
    "I cannot take the air out of 26-100 and", 
    "replace it with helium.", 
    "But what I can do, as I have done so often here in 26-100,", 
    "I can suffer myself.", 
    "I can suffer and put helium in my system.", 
    "I have here my own sound cavity.", 
    "I am, in a way, like a wind instrument.", 
    "And if I swallow helium, my sound cavity doesn't know that", 
    "I'm producing helium.", 
    "And you will say, when I talk to you as I", 
    "do right now, yeah.", 
    "That's typical.", 
    "That's Walter Lewin You recognize my fundamentals, you", 
    "recognize my harmonics, and its unique for my voice and so", 
    "you will recognize me.", 
    "But the moment that I fill my system with helium, nothing is", 
    "changing in my system, except for v. And so the frequency", 
    "will go up, and that will be noticeable.", 
    "And, in fact, chances are that you will say, hmm.", 
    "That's really not Walter Lewin anymore.", 
    "There's only one problem with helium, and that is there is", 
    "no oxygen in helium.", 
    "And that is also very noticeable for me.", 
    "And yet, I really have to fill my lungs with helium all the", 
    "way, and so I will be for a while without oxygen.", 
    "And so you may catch two birds with one stone.", 
    "You may and hear strange frequency and you", 
    "see me on the floor.", 
    "So I'll really try not to fall on the floor then.", 
    "OK.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "STUDENTS: [LAUGHTER]", 
    "WALTER LEWIN: It really don't sound like Walter Lewin", 
    "anymore, does it?", 
    "I'll see you Friday.", 
    "All the best."
