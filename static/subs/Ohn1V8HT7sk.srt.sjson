    "But when we strobe it, we can slow that down, make the thing", 
    "actually stand still.", 
    "And that's our objective.", 
    "So, you'll be able to see that.", 
    "So, let me turn on the strobe.", 
    "And this black background will help.", 
    "The strobe frequency is not exactly the same as the", 
    "frequency of the oscillating string, so that allows you to", 
    "actually see the slow motion, and no one is", 
    "arguing with me, right?", 
    "When the center portion is down, the left and the right", 
    "portion are up, and vice versa.", 
    "So, you can really see now, the characteristics of this", 
    "standing wave.", 
    "Notice, you see, in this case, four nodes.", 
    "One at either end, and you see two nodes in the middle.", 
    "That is where the sine of that curve is always 0.", 
    "I can add another strobe light, at a", 
    "slightly different frequency.", 
    "I collaborated for a few years with an artist.", 
    "His name was Tsai.", 
    "He worked at the Center for Advanced Visual", 
    "Studies here at MIT.", 
    "And he actually made art by oscillating objects at", 
    "resonant frequency, rods and strings, and he strobed them", 
    "in a way that I'm doing.", 
    "So, I actually learned this from him.", 
    "Quite pretty, but also very instructive.", 
    "You can really see what's going on.", 
    "In green, you see the string at a different moment in time", 
    "than you see it in red.", 
    "And as I said, I purposely made the frequencies of the", 
    "strobe a little different.", 
    "Thanks, Marcos.", 
    "As you perhaps remember, you can also generate a standing", 
    "wave in air itself.", 
    "Wind instruments are nothing but air columns,", 
    "which go into resonance.", 
    "If I have here, a wind instrument, which is open and", 
    "open on both sides, but this is the length of that", 
    "instrument, then the frequencies that I can", 
    "generate are given by this equation.", 
    "The only fundamental difference between the strings", 
    "and the wind instruments is that with strings, you can", 
    "change v at will, more or less.", 
    "You can choose different materials for which the speed", 
    "of propagation is different, and you can", 
    "also change the tension.", 
    "If you increase the tension this v goes up.", 
    "So you could give this violin four different strings that", 
    "give you four different fundamentals.", 
    "With a wind instrument, you cannot manipulate v because v", 
    "is the speed of sound, and so that v, of air at room", 
    "temperature, is 340 meters per second.", 
    "That's non-negotiable.", 
    "And so with wind instruments, you can very easily predict", 
    "the frequencies that you're going to hear.", 
    "I have here a pipe, which is open and open, open on both", 
    "sides, 1.5 meters long.", 
    "And if I apply that equation, I will find that the", 
    "fundamental would be 113 Hertz.", 
    "Perhaps you remember when I told you, that resonances can", 
    "occur when you sometimes least expect them.", 
    "Just by blowing air you can get resonances.", 
    "If you take a wind instrument, and you start to blow air, it", 
    "excites resonances.", 
    "Remember the Tacoma bridge, there was wind, and it went", 
    "into resonance.", 
    "It was very destructive.", 
    "Here we have a system, that we can also make go into", 
    "resonance, when you least expect it.", 
    "We have a copper grid here, and I'm going", 
    "to heat that grid.", 
    "And when I heat the grid, I get an air flow", 
    "going through there.", 
    "That all by itself will not make it go into resonance, but", 
    "when I take my heat source away, and that grid starts to", 
    "cool, it goes into resonance.", 
    "So I'm going to heat it now, it will take a while if I heat", 
    "it too long, the copper grid will melt.", 
    "Many years ago, when I was doing this with a very short", 
    "burner, the molten copper came down on my hands, which was", 
    "not funny, believe me.", 
    "If I don't do it long enough, it won't go into resonance.", 
    "So I'm sort of guessing this a little.", 
    "113 Hertz.", 
    "All right, standing electromagnetic waves.", 
    "When we go to standing electromagnetic waves-- let me", 
    "stay on the center board here--", 
    "the situation is almost identical to", 
    "standing waves on a string.", 
    "Again, we have nodes, we have locations, where the electric", 
    "field is always 0.", 
    "Very, very different from a traveling wave.", 
    "I refer you to problem 9.4, where you will see a standing", 
    "electromagnetic wave, which, just like we had with the", 
    "string, it has exactly this form.", 
    "The time domain is decoupled from the spatial domain.", 
    "The only complication that you have with a standing wave,", 
    "electromagnetic, is that it is not so easy to find the", 
    "associated magnetic field, and therefore, I refer you to that", 
    "problem 9.4 if you want to revisit that.", 
    "Polarization.", 
    "We want to see the subjects again, see where we are on the", 
    "list, but I think the time has come to talk a little bit", 
    "about polarization.", 
    "That's right.", 
    "Polarization.", 
    "Let's take electromagnetic waves that comes straight out", 
    "of the blackboard to you.", 
    "And I call these the y direction, and I call this the", 
    "x direction, and z is to you.", 
    "Notice x cross y is z, always in my case, right-handed", 
    "coordinate system.", 
    "And so the electric field vector of the plane wave that", 
    "is coming out of the blackboard, let us assume that", 
    "the electric vector is oscillating like so, with", 
    "angular frequency omega.", 
    "If this is a straight line, we call that", 
    "linearly polarized radiation.", 
    "Could be radio emission, as we did with the 75 megaHertz", 
    "transmitter, it can also be visible light.", 
    "As long as the E vector stays along a straight line, we call", 
    "that linearly polarized electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "Electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves,", 
    "including visible light, can be circularly polarized, in", 
    "which case the electric vector doesn't oscillate like you see", 
    "here, but always has the same strength and is rotating", 
    "around in a circle, either in this", 
    "direction, or in this direction.", 
    "And it's very easy to make actually.", 
    "I could have done that here in lectures, but I never did.", 
    "Suppose we have an antenna in the y direction, and we have", 
    "another one in the x direction, like our 75", 
    "megaHertz transmitter.", 
    "It was this copper bar in this direction.", 
    "And suppose each one radiates with exactly the same value", 
    "for E 0, with exactly the same frequency, but they are 90", 
    "degrees out of phase.", 
    "That's not so difficult to arrange.", 
    "Then I would get an E x, which would be E 0, and if I pick my", 
    "value for z, let's take z equals 0.", 
    "Who cares where you are in this line?", 
    "So there is no k z term, so we simply have a", 
    "cosine omega t here.", 
    "So this is the component of the electric vector in the", 
    "direction of x, and let the one in the y direction, must", 
    "be 90 degrees out of phase but must have exactly the same", 
    "amplitude, so 90 degrees out of phase, would, for instance,", 
    "be sine omega t.", 
    "Omegas must be the same to get circular polarized radiation.", 
    "And so the net electric field vector, the one that you will", 
    "experience sitting here on the z-axis, will be E x in the x", 
    "direction plus E y in the y direction.", 
    "And so the magnitude of this vector will be the square root", 
    "of E x squared plus E y squared, and that is E 0.", 
    "Because sine squared omega t plus cosine", 
    "squared omega t is 1.", 
    "And so you get under the square root E 0 squared times", 
    "1, and so that's E 0.", 
    "And so you see that the amplitude is always E 0, you", 
    "see it here in front of you.", 
    "And so it's going to rotate around when it's maximum in y,", 
    "then it is 0 in x, and when it is maximum in x, it is 0 in y.", 
    "And so therefore, you get this rotation either this way or", 
    "that way depending upon how the phase delay is arranged.", 
    "And you can turn these into elliptical polarized", 
    "radiation, by simply, for instance, putting a 2 here.", 
    "If you put a 2 there, or let me put a 2 in the x direction,", 
    "because I have more room in the x direction on the", 
    "blackboard.", 
    "So if I put a 2 here, that means, that in the x", 
    "direction, I can go twice as far as I", 
    "can go in the y direction.", 
    "And so now, the E vector will go like this.", 
    "You see this now, is twice as much as this, and so now, I", 
    "have elliptically polarized radiation.", 
    "OK, so far as far as the polarization is concerned.", 
    "Let's talk about Snell's Law.", 
    "Snell's Law was discovered 250 years before Maxwell.", 
    "It's quite an amazing accomplishment, even though", 
    "you can derive it from Maxwell's equations, of", 
    "course, but it was derived by this", 
    "Dutchman 250 years earlier.", 
    "What Snell's Law tells us is that, if we have light going", 
    "from a medium 1, with index of refraction n 1 going to medium", 
    "2 with index of refraction n 2, and this angle of incidence", 
    "is theta 1, and this is the normal to the surface, and we", 
    "get some reflection, this angle is also theta 1.", 
    "And then some of that light will enter into this medium,", 
    "and this angle will then be theta 2.", 
    "And Snell's Law says, that the sine of theta 1 divided by the", 
    "sine of theta 2 is n 1 divided by n 2.", 
    "Always the medium where you going, is up, medium where--", 
    "Oh, it's the other way around.", 
    "Good that I caught that.", 
    "This is n 2 divided by n 1, so the medium that you're going", 
    "is up, and the medium where you came from is down.", 
    "And so it's immediately obvious that if n 2 is larger", 
    "than n 1, that the angle of theta 2 is always", 
    "smaller than theta 1.", 
    "Let us assume now that you go from air to glass but that", 
    "somehow, you come out in the air again.", 
    "So right here, this is your angle of incidence now, I call", 
    "it i, it's clear that i is theta 2.", 
    "And here you're coming out of the medium in air again, and I", 
    "call this angle r, and I'm going to ask you the question", 
    "what is that angle r?"
