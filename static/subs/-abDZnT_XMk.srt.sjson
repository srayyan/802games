    "WALTER LEWIN: Regardless of whether you think of", 
    "electromagnetic radiation as plane waves, or you want to", 
    "think of them as spherical waves, or you want to think of", 
    "them as photons, I really don't care.", 
    "But what matters as far as radiation pressure is", 
    "concerned is how much power flows through one square", 
    "meter, and which fraction of that energy is absorbed, or", 
    "maybe some of it even reflected.", 
    "So the radiation pressure is not that important in our", 
    "daily lives, but it is important in astronomy.", 
    "And in fact, you can see it.", 
    "Some of you can see it.", 
    "A comet has two tails, and one of those tails is the result", 
    "of radiation pressure.", 
    "A comet is made of carbon dioxide, and it has also dust.", 
    "It's about the size of Manhattan.", 
    "And when it gets closer to the sun, the radiation pressure of", 
    "the sun, which is this radiation pressure that we", 
    "just talked about, pushes onto the dust particles, forming", 
    "the tail, and this tail is a white light, white yellowish", 
    "light, which is reflected sunlight", 
    "of these dust particles.", 
    "And then there is a second tail, which is bluish, which", 
    "is hard to see with your naked eye, and that one is the", 
    "result of the solar winds.", 
    "We discussed the solar wind earlier.", 
    "Causes the aurora in the upper atmosphere of the Earth.", 
    "The solar winds are protons and electrons, which are", 
    "emitted by the sun in a rather erratic way, sometimes a lot,", 
    "sometimes not so much.", 
    "And they move with a speed of 250 miles per second or so.", 
    "And they ionize the CO2.", 
    "So they excite the molecules.", 
    "When you have de-excitation of the molecules,", 
    "they emit blue light.", 
    "So you get two tails.", 
    "I will show you these two tails.", 
    "The tails can be 100 million kilometers in size.", 
    "They can be huge.", 
    "As some of you may remember, or should remember, in 1997 we", 
    "had a fabulous example of a comet which was Hale-Bopp.", 
    "I watched it every night for months on end.", 
    "This is a picture that you're going to see of Hale-Bopp,", 
    "which is a time exposure.", 
    "It's not what you can see with your naked eye.", 
    "In fact, frankly speaking I have never seen the blue tail.", 
    "But the white tail, which is the one due to radiation", 
    "pressure, I have seen many, many times.", 
    "So let's take a look at Hale-Bopp, and", 
    "there you see it.", 
    "And you see clearly the two tails.", 
    "You see the blue tail here, which is the result of the", 
    "interaction with the solar wind, and then here you see", 
    "the dust, which is the result, the tail is the result of", 
    "radiation pressure.", 
    "The sunlight is absorbed, fully absorbed by these dust", 
    "particles, and is pushed away.", 
    "I just wonder, who has seen Hale-Bopp three years ago?", 
    "Yeah?", 
    "Just hold your hands up.", 
    "I'm just curious.", 
    "It was a spectacular sight.", 
    "It was easy to see.", 
    "For months on end, you could see it.", 
    "You don't see very bright comets all that often.", 
    "So without being very qualitative in terms of the", 
    "electric and the magnetic field field strength, it is", 
    "easy to determine the direction of the oscillating", 
    "electric field if we know in what direction the charges", 
    "were being oscillated.", 
    "And that has to do with the polarization of the radiation.", 
    "And so I would like to spend the remaining", 
    "time today on that.", 
    "Let's stick to the center board.", 
    "So we have an oscillating charge being accelerated, and", 
    "I will choose a coordinate system like so.", 
    "And let's suppose we oscillate the charge in this direction.", 
    "Acceleration all the time, and the frequency is omega.", 
    "And we are somewhere in space here, and we receive", 
    "electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "We are at point P. I like to make you see it three", 
    "dimensionally.", 
    "And let this angle be theta, and this is the position", 
    "vector, r from the origin of the oscillating charge to", 
    "where you are.", 
    "You are at point P. And when you are at P, I'm going to", 
    "give you some very simple rules which will always allow", 
    "you to determine the direction of the electric field.", 
    "The electric field is always perpendicular to the direction", 
    "of the position vector.", 
    "The direction of propagation.", 
    "So you're looking in this direction to the charge, the", 
    "electric field that you experience if the charge is", 
    "doing this, it's always perpendicular to r.", 
    "And a and r and E are always in one plane.", 
    "And notice that's the way I drew it in the blackboard.", 
    "E and a and r are in one plane.", 
    "So it's extremely simple.", 
    "So if this is oscillating with angular frequency omega, then", 
    "this electric field will also be also be oscillating with an", 
    "angular frequency omega.", 
    "If you double the charge, the electric field will double.", 
    "If you double the acceleration, the electric", 
    "fields will also double.", 
    "That's reasonably intuitive.", 
    "So the electric field strength is proportional with the", 
    "charge that you oscillate, with the acceleration.", 
    "And then there comes this effect that we discussed", 
    "there, that nothing goes out in the direction of the", 
    "acceleration.", 
    "No energy goes out in this direction.", 
    "So no electric field is produced in this direction,", 
    "and the maximum is produced in this direction.", 
    "And somewhere in between here, and that is then reflected by", 
    "the sine of theta.", 
    "If theta is 0, nothing goes out.", 
    "If theta is 90 degrees, you get a maximum.", 
    "That's the whole plane perpendicular to this", 
    "oscillating charge.", 
    "This whole plane, maximum electric field.", 
    "And then that may not be so obvious to you now, it's also", 
    "inversely proportional to the distance r.", 
    "If you double r, the electric field strength goes down by a", 
    "factor of 2.", 
    "And the Poynting vector, which is the product of E and B, but", 
    "E is always proportional to B. So the Poynting vector, then,", 
    "is proportional to q squared, proportional to a squared,", 
    "proportional to the sine square of theta.", 
    "And inversely proportional with r squared.", 
    "And that is obvious that it has to be inversely", 
    "proportional with r squared.", 
    "Because if you go, if you have a sphere and radiation goes", 
    "out, and you're twice as far away, then you know that the", 
    "area of the sphere is four times larger.", 
    "And so the amount of power per square meter must be four", 
    "times lower.", 
    "So the Poynting vector must fall off as 1 over r squared.", 
    "That's a conservation of energy.", 
    "And if you accept the fact that the Poynting vector falls", 
    "off as 1 over r squared, then the E vector must fall off as", 
    "one over r, because the Poynting vector is the product", 
    "of E and B. E and B must both fall off as 1 over r.", 
    "I want to show you a picture that may help to see how the", 
    "radiation, how the electric field is oriented relative to", 
    "a charge that we are accelerating.", 
    "In the middle here, we accelerate a", 
    "charge up and down.", 
    "Frequency omega.", 
    "Whatever radiation you want to make, fine with me.", 
    "You can make omega as large as you want to.", 
    "For one thing, notice these waves here, these snakes", 
    "represent electromagnetic radiation.", 
    "And nothing is going out in this direction.", 
    "And we understand why.", 
    "The maximum is going out in a plane", 
    "perpendicular to this direction.", 
    "That is this, this, this, and this.", 
    "And notice that the E vector that you receive when you are", 
    "here is perpendicular to r.", 
    "This is r.", 
    "And it is perpendicular.", 
    "And notice what I said, that a and r and E are in one plane.", 
    "a, which is the acceleration, r, and E are in one plane.", 
    "a, r, and E are in one plane.", 
    "a, r, and E are in one plane.", 
    "So you can always determine the direction of the", 
    "oscillating electric field.", 
    "And if you go at an angle theta, which is near to 0,", 
    "which it is here, nor 90 degrees, which it is here,", 
    "here, and here, but if you have something in between,", 
    "then notice that the E vector here is", 
    "drawn a little smaller.", 
    "That is that sine theta here.", 
    "And consequently, the Poynting vector in that direction will", 
    "be smaller than in this direction.", 
    "And in this direction, the Poynting vector will be 0.", 
    "We call this radiation, whether you were here or", 
    "there, or there or there, we call it linearly polarized", 
    "radiation for the simple reason that the electric field", 
    "is oscillating in one direction.", 
    "It's linear.", 
    "And I'm going to produce for you", 
    "linearly polarized radiation.", 
    "And I have two demonstrations for that.", 
    "So I'll get the lights back on again.", 
    "Let's discuss these demonstrations.", 
    "I have here a transmitter which", 
    "transmits at 10 gigaHertz.", 
    "That is a wavelength of 3 centimeters.", 
    "You wouldn't call that radio, you would call that radar.", 
    "But that's just a matter of names.", 
    "And we have also a receiver.", 
    "We have a transmitter, and we have a receiver.", 
    "The transmitter is here, and the receiver is here.", 
    "If I give you a three dimensional picture, this is", 
    "my coordinate system.", 
    "This is coming straight out of the blackboard to you.", 
    "That's what I meant by this.", 
    "Then the transmitter is aimed like so.", 
    "Just like this.", 
    "Current is going to be oscillating like this.", 
    "And the receiver, think of this as my radio which is", 
    "receiving, is here.", 
    "And the antenna of the radio is also in this direction.", 
    "And so the electric field which you see here, which", 
    "comes from these oscillating charges, which oscillate, by", 
    "the way, at a horrendous frequency.", 
    "10 billion times per second.", 
    "Their electric field is perpendicular to r.", 
    "This is r.", 
    "And the electric field r and a are in one plane.", 
    "Ah.", 
    "So that means that the electric field that arrives", 
    "here is oscillating like so.", 
    "And therefore this antenna, this receiver is very happy.", 
    "The radiation comes in exactly in the right way, and so it", 
    "will receive it.", 
    "We have modulated this signal with an audio signal.", 
    "Amplitude modulation, as we discussed that earlier.", 
    "That you also use with radios.", 
    "And we modulated with approximately 1 kiloHertz", 
    "audio signal.", 
    "And we'll make you listen to that audio signal.", 
    "You can tell, then, that this receiver is indeed receiving", 
    "the 3 centimeter radar from this transmitter.", 
    "That's what we'll first do.", 
    "So I'll just turn on the transmitter, and here you hear", 
    "1 kiloHertz, which is the modulated signal.", 
    "And it's received by this antenna, which is a straight", 
    "wire like this.", 
    "And this is the emitter.", 
    "And to demonstrate to you that it really goes from here to", 
    "here, I put my hands in between.", 
    "My hands absorb 3 centimeters.", 
    "It's not there anymore.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "It's not there anymore.", 
    "Now I'm going to rotate this antenna by 90 degrees.", 
    "So this one is going to be put in this position.", 
    "So now the electric fields, so I'm going to put it now in", 
    "this position.", 
    "So the electric field now is going up and down like so.", 
    "But the receiver doesn't like that, because the antenna of", 
    "the receiver is like this.", 
    "So it cannot drive any currents.", 
    "And so you won't hear anything anymore.", 
    "So what it means is that I have changed the direction of", 
    "polarization by 90 degrees, and the", 
    "receiver cannot see that.", 
    "I'm going to rotate it now 90 degrees.", 
    "And it stops.", 
    "So now the electric field goes like this.", 
    "The wire here, the antenna is like this, and the wire says,", 
    "sorry, can't hear you.", 
    "All I have to do now is rotate the receiver 90 degrees.", 
    "And so I can rotate this antenna and put it vertical,", 
    "and then of course it's happy again.", 
    "If I rotate this 90 degrees, there comes the signal back.", 
    "So now the E field is like so, and the antenna", 
    "receives it like so.", 
    "Now I have one brain teaser for you.", 
    "And I want you to think about that.", 
    "We can actually have a vote on that.", 
    "I have here a wooden frame with metal bars.", 
    "No trick.", 
    "Metal bars.", 
    "And I'm going to put that in between here.", 
    "So we have the situation that we are transmitting", 
    "electromagnetic waves with the E field going like this, and", 
    "the receiver is perfectly happy.", 
    "The receiver is also aligned like this.", 
    "There you have it.", 
    "I can put this grid in like so, so that the bars are in", 
    "the same direction as E.", 
    "But I can also put it in like so.", 
    "The bars are perpendicular to E. If I make you a drawing, if", 
    "you would look in this direction, then I can do one", 
    "of two things.", 
    "Either the bars are like so, or the bars are like so.", 
    "But in both cases is the electric field", 
    "coming in like this.", 
    "Who thinks that if I have the bars vertical, that the", 
    "electromagnetic radiation will go straight through without", 
    "any problem?", 
    "Who thinks that maybe it will not get through?", 
    "Who thinks it will get through?", 
    "Who thinks it will not get through?", 
    "Now I do this.", 
    "Who thinks that the electromagnetic radiation, the", 
    "oscillating E field can easily go through this?", 
    "Who thinks it will not get through?", 
    "It's very evenly divided.", 
    "We have about 25, 25, 25, 25.", 
    "OK.", 
    "We'll see.", 
    "1 kiloHertz.", 
    "E field is like this.", 
    "Receiver is receiving it.", 
    "What do you want me to do first?", 
    "This or this?", 
    "Let's do this first.", 
    "Nothing.", 
    "It's not observed.", 
    "Goes straight through here.", 
    "Now rotate it 90 degrees.", 
    "I kill it.", 
    "So in this configuration, electromagnetic radiation does", 
    "not get through.", 
    "I want you to think about it.", 
    "And if you have some sleepless nights about", 
    "it, that's OK too.", 
    "That's very healthy."
