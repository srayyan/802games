    "then we have 100% reflection.", 
    "So let me first turn on the laser, so that there is a", 
    "little bit of light.", 
    "And I'm going to show it to you there for those of you who", 
    "are not sitting very close.", 
    "And that means I have to set the light situation.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So there you see the light coming in just the way we had", 
    "on the blackboard.", 
    "This is the way it comes in in water.", 
    "This is the reflected part.", 
    "And this is the one that is refracted into the air.", 
    "So that is this one here.", 
    "And now I'm going to increase that angle.", 
    "When I touch the table, the water will", 
    "start to wiggle a little.", 
    "And you will probably see that.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I'm going to increase that angle.", 
    "Look how I'm increasing it.", 
    "Look that theta 2 is getting larger, is going to approach", 
    "the 90 degrees.", 
    "Increase theta 1.", 
    "I increase theta 1.", 
    "Look at theta 2, almost 90 degrees.", 
    "I'm very close to the critical angle now.", 
    "I'm almost at it right now.", 
    "And now all the light is being reflected, 100% reflection, a", 
    "remarkable phenomenon.", 
    "And this has practical applications.", 
    "And we're going to show you some of these practical", 
    "applications too.", 
    "The most important practical application is fiber optics.", 
    "If I have a fiber, and it is properly designed--", 
    "so this is a fiber.", 
    "And some light comes in here.", 
    "And it hits here.", 
    "So this is, say, some plastic or glass.", 
    "And this is air.", 
    "If this angle of incidence is larger than the critical", 
    "angle, 100% is reflected.", 
    "And so nothing comes out in the air, 100% reflected.", 
    "Here, again the critical angle is exceeded.", 
    "And so 100% is reflected.", 
    "And you can go through this whole thing for miles on end.", 
    "You can put even knots in there.", 
    "As long as you never exceed the critical angle, that light", 
    "will propagate.", 
    "And there will never be any loss of light.", 
    "And that's why people are very much interested in it.", 
    "You can transport even images as I will show you through", 
    "fiber optics.", 
    "I have here fiber optics which has 4,000 fibers in it, 50", 
    "microns in diameter each.", 
    "And we have a laser beam here.", 
    "And the laser light will come out.", 
    "I will show you a laser light shortly there.", 
    "And it doesn't matter what I do with the fibers.", 
    "I can even go 180 degrees and shine them there, as long as", 
    "inside the fiber I always exceed the critical angle.", 
    "Oh, I don't want the television anymore.", 
    "So we can turn this off.", 
    "And let's here have these laser lights.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "You see the laser light.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Now look at this bundle that I have here.", 
    "I turn it into an absurd snake, almost like an S. All", 
    "the light still comes out.", 
    "So it goes all the way through.", 
    "I'm going to put it 180 degrees", 
    "around to the wall there.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "So there's an amazing phenomenon that this light", 
    "doesn't get out in the air.", 
    "It stays inside the fiber.", 
    "And that's the idea behind fiber optics.", 
    "I have another application of fiber optics right here, which", 
    "is very similar.", 
    "You can send an image through fiber optics.", 
    "This is my fiber optics now, thousands of small fibers.", 
    "And I send a message in here.", 
    "This side, an image--", 
    "could be a person, could be a text.", 
    "And here we have a TV camera.", 
    "And we can watch that image.", 
    "On this side of the fiber appears that image.", 
    "And this television camera will be", 
    "able to see that image.", 
    "And let's see whether we can show you that message.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I have to do something here again.", 
    "I think you're going to--", 
    "Ah, there it is.", 
    "So you actually can see the individual fibers.", 
    "You see them?", 
    "How interesting.", 
    "Each one of these are individual fibers, and their", 
    "diameter is probably not much more than 50 or 100 microns.", 
    "Let's see what message there is for you.", 
    "Oh, man.", 
    "Oh, man.", 
    "Exam 3.", 
    "You don't want to hear about that, do you?", 
    "Well it depends on what the message says.", 
    "Problem.", 
    "No.", 
    "No.", 
    "Problem 1, problem 1--", 
    "the figure--", 
    "oh, oh, oh, oh, below.", 
    "Oh, that's the wrong message.", 
    "I couldn't possibly meant to give you away", 
    "the exam, of course.", 
    "So I apologize for that, that I showed", 
    "you the wrong message.", 
    "But at least it demonstrated to that you can send an image", 
    "through fiber optics, even secret messages.", 
    "Newton had an interesting explanation for Snell's law.", 
    "Newton was a man of planets.", 
    "He was a man of particles, masses, accelerations, F", 
    "equals m a.", 
    "And so his explanation came with particles.", 
    "He says lights are particles.", 
    "So if this is the surface between, let's say, air and", 
    "water, Newton argued as follows.", 
    "As light comes in, it has a certain speed, v 1.", 
    "And therefore, it has a horizontal component.", 
    "And it has a certain vertical component.", 
    "And he says if this light ends up in water, at the moment", 
    "that it reaches the surface, it gets an acceleration", 
    "perpendicular to the surface.", 
    "Why?", 
    "He didn't tell us.", 
    "But he said it gets an acceleration perpendicular to", 
    "the surface.", 
    "In other words, this horizontal", 
    "component does not change.", 
    "That remains what it was.", 
    "But this component changes.", 
    "This becomes substantially larger, depending upon the", 
    "index of refraction of course.", 
    "And so the new velocity is now in this direction.", 
    "And so you see that indeed the angle, theta 1, is larger than", 
    "the angle, theta 2.", 
    "But Snell's law immediately follows from this.", 
    "The sine of theta 1--", 
    "this angle is theta 1.", 
    "So this angle is theta 1.", 
    "So that's this velocity divided by this vector.", 
    "And the sine of theta 2 is this velocity", 
    "divided by this vector.", 
    "But these two velocities are the same.", 
    "And so you immediately find that this ratio is v 2 divided", 
    "by v 1, a great victory for Mr. Newton.", 
    "Except there was one problem, maybe that it means that v 2", 
    "is larger than v 1.", 
    "And so Newton argued that the speed of light in water is", 
    "larger than the speed of light in air.", 
    "And in glass, of course, it would be even larger.", 
    "Now there was a Dutchman.", 
    "And the name of Dutchman was Christiaan Huygens,", 
    "H-U-Y-G-E-N-S.", 
    "And this gentleman suggested that perhaps light are not", 
    "particles, that they are waves.", 
    "And this guy came up with a genius idea, which we now know", 
    "as Huygens' Principle-- at least, you", 
    "call it Huygens' Principle.", 
    "But we don't call it Huygens' Principle.", 
    "You see, this sound, u-y is pronounced in Dutch as \"ow.\"", 
    "None of you can say \"ow\" unless you're Dutch.", 
    "To make it worse, this sound you don't", 
    "have either in English.", 
    "That's a [THROAT CLEARING]", 
    "None of you can say [THROAT CLEARING]", 
    "unless you're Dutch, let alone that you can say the", 
    "combination, Huygens.", 
    "Anyone who comes forward to me after this lecture and knows", 
    "how to pronounce the word, Huygens, has to be Dutch.", 
    "I will be kind to you and call it today Huygens' Principle.", 
    "So Huygens came with the following idea.", 
    "Here is a source of electromagnetic waves.", 
    "And these electromagnetic waves propagate out in a", 
    "spherical way, not unreasonable.", 
    "And so you even see here the wave crest.", 
    "And so he defined the surface at the leading part of the", 
    "wave, where all points are in phase.", 
    "He called that the wave front.", 
    "So this is the wave front.", 
    "And he now postulated that each point of the wave front", 
    "individually oscillates at the same frequency as the source", 
    "and produces spherical waves.", 
    "We call them secondary waves, also called wavelets.", 
    "And that the envelope of the wave front of these secondary", 
    "waves is now the new wave front.", 
    "So it works as follows.", 
    "Each point that you can choose--", 
    "you can choose as many as you want to--", 
    "starts to oscillate at the same frequency as the source,", 
    "and produces on its own spherical waves.", 
    "There they go.", 
    "And the new wave front is then here.", 
    "And this is called Huygens' Principle.", 
    "Because he doesn't give any explanation of why these", 
    "points do that.", 
    "He hypothesized that.", 
    "And this principle can explain Snell's law", 
    "in a very easy way.", 
    "I want you to read up on that in your book.", 
    "And you will see that it is very easy to explain Snell's", 
    "law with this principle.", 
    "Except that now you will conclude that the sine of", 
    "theta 1 divided by the sine of theta 2 is v 1 divided by v 2.", 
    "And therefore Huygens predicted that the speed of", 
    "light in water is lower than the speed of light in air,", 
    "whereas Newton predicted that the speed of light in water", 
    "would be higher than the speed of light in air.", 
    "So the question now was who was right?", 
    "Are light particles?", 
    "Or are they waves?", 
    "Well the wave-particle idea of light has been a very long", 
    "standing issue in physics.", 
    "And I will show you, I think next week or maybe after the", 
    "exam, how Young in 1801 conclusively demonstrated that", 
    "light are waves.", 
    "So it looked like Huygens was going to be the winner.", 
    "On the other hand, I showed you last lecture that light", 
    "can behave like particles, photons, bullets, tomatoes,", 
    "radiation pressure--", 
    "that's particles, the whole thing, the whole ball of wax.", 
    "And so maybe Newton was right.", 
    "Maybe they are particles.", 
    "Well, they are both right.", 
    "There are times that you can actually interpret what you", 
    "see best by assuming they are waves and that there are times", 
    "that it is much better to assume that they are", 
    "particles, like in the case of the radiation pressure.", 
    "But of course, the key question now is, who was right", 
    "in terms of the speed of light?", 
    "Is the light going faster in water?", 
    "Then Newton was right.", 
    "Or is the light going slower in water?", 
    "Then Huygens was right.", 
    "Needless to say that the Dutchman was right.", 
    "The speed of light in water is lower than the", 
    "speed of light in air.", 
    "When we derived the speed of light in vacuum, we used", 
    "Maxwell's equations.", 
    "And they allowed us to conclude that the speed of", 
    "light, much to everyone's surprise, depends on epsilon 0", 
    "and mu 0 in a very simple way.", 
    "I will call it, for now, v, that was one over the square", 
    "root of epsilon 0 mu 0.", 
    "And we call that c.", 
    "If you have used Maxwell's equations as they are valid in", 
    "materials in dielectrics and also in materials that have", 
    "magnetic properties, then it would be exactly the same", 
    "derivation.", 
    "But you would have seen a kappa here,", 
    "the dielectric constant.", 
    "And you would have seen here the magnetic permeability.", 
    "Kappa, if you're not in air but in glass and water, always", 
    "larger than one.", 
    "So you see in front of you that the speed of light in", 
    "water is lower than the speed of light in air.", 
    "This can also be written as c divided by the square root of", 
    "kappa divided by kappa m.", 
    "And we would nowadays simply write it as c divided by n.", 
    "So the index of refraction is really the square root of the", 
    "product of the dielectric constant and the magnetic", 
    "permeability."
