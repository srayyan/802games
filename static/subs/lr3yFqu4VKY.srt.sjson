    "WALTER LEWIN: And so you deal there with numbers that are", 
    "100, 1,000, 10,000, and even larger than 10,000.", 
    "That means that if kappa of M is 10,000, you would have a", 
    "field inside ferromagnetic material that is 10,000 times", 
    "larger than your vacuum field.", 
    "Next lecture, I will tell you that there is a limit to as", 
    "far as you can go.", 
    "But for now, we will leave it with this.", 
    "So paramagnetic and ferromagnetic properties", 
    "depend on the temperature.", 
    "Diamagnetic properties do not depend on the temperature.", 
    "So at very low temperatures, there's very", 
    "little thermal agitation.", 
    "And so you can then easier align these dipoles, and so", 
    "the values for kappa of M will then be different.", 
    "Ferromagnetic material, if you cool it, you expect the kappa", 
    "of M going up.", 
    "So you get a stronger field inside.", 
    "So it's temperature dependent.", 
    "If you make the material very hot, then it can lose", 
    "completely it's ferromagnetic properties.", 
    "What happens at a certain temperature that these domains", 
    "fall apart.", 
    "So the domains themselves no longer exist.", 
    "They annihilate.", 
    "And that happens at a very precise temperature.", 
    "It's very strange.", 
    "That's also something that is very difficult to understand,", 
    "the unique quantum mechanics for that, too.", 
    "But at a certain temperature, which we call the Curie", 
    "temperature, which for iron is 1,043 degrees Kelvin, which is", 
    "770 degrees centigrade, all of a", 
    "sudden the domains disappear.", 
    "And the material becomes paramagnetic.", 
    "In other words, if ferromagnetic material would", 
    "be hanging on a magnet, and you would heat it up above the", 
    "Curie point, it would fall off.", 
    "It would become paramagnetic.", 
    "But paramagnetic material, in general,", 
    "doesn't hang on a magnet.", 
    "Because the forces involved are quite small.", 
    "And the change is very abrupt.", 
    "And I'm going to show that to you with a demonstration.", 
    "I have a ferromagnetic nut right there.", 
    "You will see it very shortly.", 
    "And this is nut, or washer, hanging on a steel cable, and", 
    "there is here a magnet.", 
    "I don't know whether this is north or south.", 
    "It doesn't matter.", 
    "And here we have a thermal shield.", 
    "And so this washer is against the thermal shield because", 
    "it's being attracted.", 
    "It wants to go towards the strong magnetic field.", 
    "It's ferromagnetic.", 
    "So it will be sitting here.", 
    "And now I'm going to heat this up above the Curie point, 770", 
    "degrees centigrade.", 
    "And you will see it fall off.", 
    "And when it cools again, it goes back on again.", 
    "So I can make you see", 
    "ferromagnetic properties disappear.", 
    "And let me make sure I have the proper settings.", 
    "I see nothing.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "So here is this nut.", 
    "And here is this shield.", 
    "And the magnet is behind it.", 
    "You can't see it.", 
    "It's right there.", 
    "So it goes against it.", 
    "It goes towards the magnetic pole.", 
    "It goes into the strong magnetic field.", 
    "The magnetic field is nonuniform outside a magnet.", 
    "And it goes towards it.", 
    "And so now I'm going to heat it.", 
    "It will take a while, because 770 degrees centigrade is not", 
    "so easy to achieve.", 
    "The three most common ferromagnetic materials are", 
    "cobalt, nickel, and iron.", 
    "Nickel has a Curie point of only 358 degrees centigrade.", 
    "So if this were nickel--", 
    "if this were nickel--", 
    "you like that?", 
    "I think I need a strong hand.", 
    "A strong hand is coming.", 
    "OK, I think I fixed it.", 
    "I'm a big boy.", 
    "I did it myself today.", 
    "I lost my pen, but that's a detail.", 
    "OK, let's try again.", 
    "So I'm going to heat it up.", 
    "And I was mentioning that nickel has a Curie point of", 
    "358 degrees centigrade.", 
    "So that's quite low.", 
    "This is 770.", 
    "Cobalt is 1400 degrees Kelvin, Curie point.", 
    "Gadolinium is a very special material.", 
    "Gadolinium is ferromagnetic in the winter, when the", 
    "temperature is below 16 degrees centigrade.", 
    "But it is paramagnetic in the summer, when the temperature", 
    "is above 16 degrees centigrade.", 
    "It's beginning to be red hot now.", 
    "770 degrees Centigrade, you expect some visible light in", 
    "the form of red light.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "And I will keep it heating.", 
    "I will keep the torch on it so that you can see that indeed", 
    "it's no longer attracted by the magnet.", 
    "And the moment that I stop heating it, it will very", 
    "quickly cool.", 
    "It will become ferromagnetic again.", 
    "And it will go back.", 
    "Just watch it.", 
    "There it goes.", 
    "So now it's again ferromagnetic.", 
    "So the transition is extremely short.", 
    "All right.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So paramagnetic materials, as I mentioned several times, in", 
    "general, cannot hang on a magnet.", 
    "The attractive force is just not enough.", 
    "To hang on a magnet, the force has to be larger", 
    "than its own weight.", 
    "And diamagnetic material is, of course, completely out.", 
    "Because diamagnetic materials are always pushed towards the", 
    "weak parts of the field.", 
    "It's only paramagnetic materials and ferromagnetic", 
    "materials that experience of force towards the strong part", 
    "of the field if the field itself is nonuniform.", 
    "Now there's one very interesting exception.", 
    "And I want to draw your attention to this", 
    "transparency here.", 
    "Look here at oxygen at one atmosphere.", 
    "Oxygen at one atmosphere and 300 degrees Kelvin has a value", 
    "for chi of M, which is 2 times 10 to the -6.", 
    "But now look at liquid oxygen.", 
    "At 90 degrees Kelvin that value is 1800 times larger", 
    "than this value.", 
    "Why is that so much higher?", 
    "Well liquid, in general is about 1,000 times denser than", 
    "gas at one atmosphere.", 
    "So you have 1,000 times more dipoles per cubic meter that,", 
    "in principle, can align.", 
    "And so clearly you expect an immediate one to one", 
    "correspondence between the density--", 
    "how many dipoles you have per cubic meter--", 
    "and the value for chi of M. And so you see indeed that", 
    "this value is substantially larger.", 
    "The reason why it is more than a factor of 1,000 higher is", 
    "that the temperature was also lower.", 
    "You go from 300 degrees 90 degrees.", 
    "And that gives you another factor of two.", 
    "Because when the temperature is lower, there is less", 
    "thermal agitation.", 
    "And so the external fields can align the dipoles more easily.", 
    "And so that's why you end up with a factor of 1800.", 
    "Even though this value for chi of M is extraordinarily high", 
    "for a paramagnetic material, notice that the field inside", 
    "would only be 0.35% higher than the vacuum field.", 
    "Because if chi of M is 3.5 times 10 to the -3, that means", 
    "that the field inside is only 0.35% percent higher than the", 
    "vacuum field.", 
    "But that is enough for liquid oxygen to be attracted by a", 
    "very strong magnet, provided that it also has a very non", 
    "uniform field outside the magnet.", 
    "And so the force with which liquid oxygen is pulled", 
    "towards a magnet can be made larger than the weight of the", 
    "liquid oxygen.", 
    "And so I can make you see today that I can have liquid", 
    "oxygen hanging from a magnet.", 
    "And that's what we're going to do here.", 
    "Make sure I have the right setting.", 
    "This is it.", 
    "We're going to have some changes in the light.", 
    "So there you see the two magnetic poles.", 
    "It's an electromagnet.", 
    "And so we can turn the magnetic field on at will.", 
    "So here are the poles of the magnet.", 
    "And the first thing I will do is very boring.", 
    "I'll throw some liquid nitrogen between the poles.", 
    "Now, I don't have the value for liquid nitrogen there.", 
    "But nitrogen is diamagnetic.", 
    "So it's not even an issue.", 
    "Diamagnetic material is pushed away from the strong field.", 
    "So even though the value for chi of M will be very", 
    "different for liquid nitrogen than it is for gaseous", 
    "nitrogen, it doesn't matter.", 
    "So certainly, it will be pushed out.", 
    "That's the first thing I want to do, just to bore you a", 
    "little bit.", 
    "Because I have to keep you on the edge of your seat before", 
    "you're going to see this oxygen, which will", 
    "be hanging in there.", 
    "So let's first power this magnet.", 
    "I hope I did that.", 
    "Yes, I think I did.", 
    "And here comes the liquid nitrogen.", 
    "Boring like hell.", 
    "Just falls through.", 
    "Now comes the oxygen.", 
    "Liquid oxygen.", 
    "It's hanging in there.", 
    "I challenge you, you've never in your life seen liquid", 
    "hanging on a magnet.", 
    "You can tell your parents about it, and of course your", 
    "grandchildren.", 
    "It's hanging there.", 
    "I'll put some more in.", 
    "Make sure I have the right stuff.", 
    "Put some more in.", 
    "There is liquid oxygen.", 
    "When I break the current, it's no longer a magnet.", 
    "It will fall, of course.", 
    "Don't worry.", 
    "You'll get more.", 
    "Who has ever in his life seen a liquid hang on a magnet?", 
    "It's paramagnetic.", 
    "It's not ferromagnetic.", 
    "But because the density is so high, and because it's so", 
    "cold, the value for chi of M is high enough that the force", 
    "on it is larger than its own weight.", 
    "If you do this with aluminum, not a chance in the world.", 
    "Aluminum will not hang in there.", 
    "Even though, aluminum, as you can see there, is", 
    "paramagnetic.", 
    "But the value 2 times 10 to the -5 is way too small.", 
    "And it will not stick to a magnet.", 
    "OK, you have something to think about.", 
    "I'll see you Friday."
