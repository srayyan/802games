    "WALTER LEWIN: If I return to this curve here, if I redefine", 
    "my time equals zero, and if this is the moment that I put", 
    "the switch in position two, then I expect that the", 
    "capacitor will discharge.", 
    "And you get a curve like this.", 
    "And I expect that the current, which now becomes negative--", 
    "it reverses direction, and I call that negative--", 
    "and so the current will come like this.", 
    "And if you wait long enough, of course, the current will", 
    "again become zero.", 
    "You have discharged the capacitor.", 
    "So if you want the formal solution, you have to go back", 
    "to the differential equation and you take this term out", 
    "because it's not there.", 
    "And now you have to solve this differential equation again", 
    "which is utterly trivial.", 
    "And I would like you to solve that differential equation.", 
    "You couldn't have an easier one.", 
    "I will give you the solution to I as a function of time.", 
    "And you then will come up with this part.", 
    "I as a function of time is exactly the same as this", 
    "except there's a minus sign--", 
    "provided that I call this t equals zero.", 
    "So I redefine the zero time.", 
    "And so I as a function of time is the equation that you have", 
    "here but now with a minus sign.", 
    "So you've got an exponential change again but the current", 
    "has flipped over.", 
    "I can demonstrate this to you.", 
    "I have a electronic switch so I go between one and two.", 
    "Every 4 milliseconds, I throw the switch.", 
    "And so what I have is, as a function of time, what we call", 
    "a square wave.", 
    "So this is my battery.", 
    "And this time here from here to here is 8 milliseconds.", 
    "This is time.", 
    "And so this is that value V 0.", 
    "And the values that I have chosen for R and C, I will", 
    "give them to you.", 
    "The value for V 0 here is 1 volt, and here", 
    "of course it's zero.", 
    "The value that I have chosen for R is 6 kiloohms.", 
    "And the value I have for C I think is 0.1 microfarad.", 
    "Yes, that's what it is.", 
    "And there's a reason why I've chosen these values.", 
    "This is 0.1 microfarads.", 
    "And so the R C time is 6 times 10 to the -4 seconds.", 
    "So this is 0.6 milliseconds, which is substantially", 
    "smaller than 4.", 
    "And so you can expect that the capacitor becomes almost fully", 
    "charged in this 4 milliseconds.", 
    "That's why I chose the R C time substantially smaller", 
    "than 4 milliseconds.", 
    "And my set up is such that I can show you the input, the", 
    "driving voltage of the battery.", 
    "I can show you this.", 
    "I can show you then how the capacitor is charged and how", 
    "the capacitor is discharged with the time constant R C and", 
    "also how the current goes through the system.", 
    "So I can show you also this curve.", 
    "And then I can change the capacitor so that", 
    "the R C time changes.", 
    "I can also change the resistance.", 
    "So let me change first the lights so that you get", 
    "high-quality for your money.", 
    "You already see there the switching voltage between 1", 
    "volt and 0.", 
    "And now I'm going to show you the", 
    "voltage over the capacitor.", 
    "And I will take the other one out.", 
    "And here you see indeed exactly the", 
    "image that we discussed.", 
    "So you see early on the charging of the capacitor and", 
    "it reaches effectively the maximum value.", 
    "You don't have to wait infinitely long.", 
    "As always, we say infinitely long, but that's clearly if", 
    "you wait three or four, five times R C, then", 
    "you're almost there.", 
    "And then here, I'm going to switch it back to position two", 
    "where you see it's discharging.", 
    "And then its charging up again and discharging.", 
    "And now I can also show you the current.", 
    "You see it on the same plot as the capacitor is charging, you", 
    "see the current is high.", 
    "But by the time that the capacitor is fully charged,", 
    "the current is zero.", 
    "But the moment that I throw the switch to position two,", 
    "the current flips direction, becomes negative, and then as", 
    "the capacitor discharges and heat is dissipated in the", 
    "resistor, ultimately the current", 
    "again will become zero.", 
    "What I can do now is to increase my capacitance by,", 
    "for instance, a factor of five.", 
    "That would change my R C time to three milliseconds.", 
    "So now there is no way that the capacitor can become fully", 
    "charged in the 4 milliseconds that it has.", 
    "And you will see that indeed if I make this 0.5 microfarad", 
    "that you see that the capacitor has not enough time", 
    "to get fully charged.", 
    "And so here, you begin to discharge.", 
    "Notice also that the current doesn't reach the zero.", 
    "For the same reason that the capacitor", 
    "doesn't get fully charged.", 
    "So it never reaches the point that the current becomes zero.", 
    "I'm already switching here to position two.", 
    "And the current then flips over but never becomes zero.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So let's go back to 0.1 value.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "This is easier than LR circuits for the reason that", 
    "we don't have to deal with Faraday's law.", 
    "We don't have a nonconservative field.", 
    "And so it's easier to imagine things.", 
    "Because we're dealing with Kirchhoff's law.", 
    "So potential differences are uniquely defined and don't", 
    "depend on the path whereas with Faraday's Law, they do", 
    "depend on the path.", 
    "So now I want to change to a different subject which is", 
    "transformers.", 
    "Transformers play a very important role in our lives.", 
    "Transformers are key in many instruments that you use at", 
    "home but also key in getting the energy all the way from", 
    "the power station to us as you will see.", 
    "A full understanding of transformers is not easy.", 
    "It's extremely complicated.", 
    "It's really more like an engineering problem than a", 
    "physics problem.", 
    "I will give you a simplified version in which I leave a lot", 
    "of details out.", 
    "But the basic idea will be there.", 
    "Here I have a coil and I call this coil the primary.", 
    "This coil has N1 windings and has a self inductance L1.", 
    "And I put here a volt meter which I call V1.", 
    "It's always in that circuit.", 
    "And a current I1 is running through", 
    "the coil and returning.", 
    "And there's a teeny, weeny little current i1.", 
    "I put a little i there, running", 
    "through this voltmeter.", 
    "Insignificantly small, so I just call this also I1 because", 
    "this i1 is so small.", 
    "But it allows me to always monitor V1.", 
    "So that's the primary.", 
    "Now we have a secondary which is wound in such a way that is", 
    "a magnetic flux coupling between the two.", 
    "This is the secondary.", 
    "It has N2 windings.", 
    "Self inductance is L2.", 
    "And I put here a voltmeter, V2.", 
    "The current I2 is flowing here.", 
    "This is I2.", 
    "Here is the consumer.", 
    "This is where you are maybe.", 
    "And I2 is flowing back through the core.", 
    "And here is this teeny weeny little current i2 flowing so", 
    "that I can monitor the value of V2.", 
    "What I can do now is I can write down the closed loop", 
    "integral of E dot dl for this closed circuit here and I have", 
    "to apply of course Faraday's law.", 
    "Because I now have a changing magnetic flux.", 
    "You're always AC.", 
    "Transformers always require alternating current.", 
    "And so if I start here and I go through the self-inductor,", 
    "I know that there's no electric field in the", 
    "self-inductor.", 
    "So that contribution of E dot dl is zero.", 
    "Then I arrive here at this current which is opposing me.", 
    "I go in this direction but the E field is opposing me.", 
    "And so I get minus V1.", 
    "And that now, according to Faraday's law, since I went in", 
    "the direction of the current through the self-inductor", 
    "equals -L1 dI1/dt.", 
    "And I'll tell you what the simplification is that I made", 
    "because I want to be honest with you about where I am", 
    "rigid and where I am not.", 
    "There is really a second term here, which is the mutual", 
    "inductance between the two coils.", 
    "And there should really be a term here in terms of that", 
    "mutual inductance capital M times dI2/dt.", 
    "And I leave it out here.", 
    "I leave it out because the final result in most cases is", 
    "not affected by it.", 
    "But I want you to know that strictly speaking, this", 
    "equation is simplified.", 
    "I know that this is the electric field", 
    "induced in side 1.", 
    "And now I do the same on the secondary side.", 
    "I start here.", 
    "The current I2 is in the same direction as the direction", 
    "that I move.", 
    "So I have plus V2.", 
    "Then I go through the self-inductor.", 
    "There's no electric field in the self-inductor because", 
    "there's no electric field in a wire that has no resistance.", 
    "And that now, since I went in the direction of the current,", 
    "is minus L2 dI2/dt.", 
    "And again, I bury the M contribution.", 
    "And this now equals the EMF induced in the secondary.", 
    "But clearly this is also N1 times d phi B/dt", 
    "with a minus sign.", 
    "This is the magnetic flux change through one loop in the", 
    "primary, the surface of one loop and the primary sees a", 
    "magnetic flux going through it which is changing with time.", 
    "And that value, d phi B/dt is through one loop.", 
    "But I have N1 loops.", 
    "So I have an N1 there.", 
    "And so in the secondary, I have N2 times the same d phi", 
    "B/dt, if I have perfect magnetic coupling between the", 
    "two loops, which is not always the case.", 
    "And so now you see that I have that V2 over V1, if I take the", 
    "magnitude, is now simply N2 over N1.", 
    "That is an amazing result.", 
    "It tells you that you can make V2 on the secondary side way", 
    "larger than V1--", 
    "we call that transforming up--", 
    "by making N2 larger than N1.", 
    "But you can also make it lower.", 
    "We call it a step-down transformer, by making N2", 
    "smaller than N1.", 
    "When I write down capital V here, you should think of that", 
    "as an alternating current.", 
    "So we have cosine omega t's in there or sine omega t's.", 
    "You should think of this perhaps as the", 
    "maximum value possible.", 
    "But of course that's not important in the concept.", 
    "But there are always cosine omega t's all over the place.", 
    "The power station puts the electricity, so to speak, on", 
    "the line at 300,000 volts.", 
    "We discussed that earlier, why they do that", 
    "at such high voltage.", 
    "So they have a transformer from their generator to", 
    "transform the potential up to a very high", 
    "value, to 300,000 volts.", 
    "When it arrives at Boston, it's", 
    "stepped down to 12 kilovolts.", 
    "And so there are transformers which you see, huge", 
    "transformers, which have ratio N1 over N2 of 25.", 
    "So N1 is 25 times larger than N2.", 
    "So I step it down to 12 kilovolts.", 
    "But you don't want 12 kilovolts at your home.", 
    "You want 110, 120 volts at home.", 
    "So when you look at these power poles outside people's", 
    "homes, you see again transformers in these power", 
    "poles which bring it down from 12 kilovolts", 
    "to about 120 volts.", 
    "So there you have a ratio N1 over N2 of about 100.", 
    "To calculate the ratios of the currents I1 and", 
    "I2 is way more tricky.", 
    "There are some big ifs.", 
    "And one big if is that R in the primary and the secondary", 
    "side is much, much smaller than omega L. That is one if.", 
    "The second if is that no energy is lost in terms of", 
    "eddy currents.", 
    "Very often these two coils are coupled through an iron core.", 
    "And then you get eddy current in the iron core", 
    "and you lose energy.", 
    "Also, do you not always have ideal flux coupling.", 
    "So it is not always true that the magnetic flux through one", 
    "coil in the primary is the same as the one to one coil in", 
    "the secondary.", 
    "But if all of that were the case--", 
    "so if R is much, much less than omega L and if there is", 
    "no energy loss in eddy currents and if there is", 
    "perfect flux coupling, then you can show that whatever", 
    "power is delivered on the primary side is going to be", 
    "consumed on the secondary side.", 
    "And if that is true--", 
    "if the power delivered on the primary side which is I1 V1--", 
    "if that is the same as the power consumed on the", 
    "secondary side, then that must be I2 V2.", 
    "But if this is true--", 
    "which is only under those conditions--", 
    "and this is also correct, then of course, you will find now", 
    "that I2 divided by I1 is N1 divided by N2.", 
    "And let's put here magnitudes again so that we're not", 
    "worried about possible minus signs.", 
    "And now you look at this, you see that you can generate, if", 
    "you want to in the secondary, an enormously high current by", 
    "simply having a large ratio N1 to N2.", 
    "And I will demonstrate that today, that indeed, if you", 
    "meet those conditions that you can indeed do that.", 
    "I2 over I1, that's fine.", 
    "V2 over V1, that's fine.", 
    "So I will do two demonstrations.", 
    "The first thing I want to demonstrate", 
    "is that if I make--", 
    "oh that's beautiful.", 
    "I have to erase something here.", 
    "Or actually, I can work on this board here for a while.", 
    "I have here a demonstration whereby you see here the", 
    "primary coil.", 
    "You see it right in front of you.", 
    "It has 220 windings.", 
    "So N1 is 220.", 
    "And V1 is 110 volts.", 
    "And it is AC, has to be.", 
    "The frequency is 60 hertz, just what we get out of the", 
    "plug here like you get it in your dormitory.", 
    "That means omega is about 377.", 
    "It's 2 pi times f.", 
    "If I give you really the correct value for V1, it's", 
    "really the maximum value for V1 times the", 
    "cosine of omega t.", 
    "And this value is really 110 times the square root of 2.", 
    "I've mentioned that earlier in my lectures.", 
    "The voltmeter, however, are designed in such a way that", 
    "they only show you 110.", 
    "And so we call that 110 volts."
