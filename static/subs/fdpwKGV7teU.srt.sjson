    "mechanical resonances with you.", 
    "Last Friday, we discussed the resonances of string", 
    "instruments and wind instruments.", 
    "But there are several that you see around you quite often", 
    "without realizing it, perhaps, that you're looking at a", 
    "resonance frequency.", 
    "You may have noticed the traffic signs have the", 
    "tendency sometimes to do this.", 
    "And at certain wind speeds, they go like this.", 
    "Enormously strong amplitude.", 
    "That's a form of resonance.", 
    "Undoubtedly, you have been at motels or at homes where you", 
    "open a faucet, and then all of a sudden, when the water's", 
    "running in a certain way, you get an incredible noise, a", 
    "terrible noise.", 
    "You close the faucet a little, or you open it a little", 
    "further, and that noise goes away.", 
    "That's clearly an example of resonance.", 
    "You drive your car, or someone else's car, and at a certain", 
    "speed something begins to rattle.", 
    "Very annoying.", 
    "You go a little faster, it stops.", 
    "You go a little slower, it stops.", 
    "Or if you go a little faster, something", 
    "else begins to rattle.", 
    "There's some other resonance of something else in the car.", 
    "Of course, there are cars whereby something", 
    "rattles at any speed.", 
    "But in any case, there's always this idea, then, of", 
    "resonance, which is all around us.", 
    "I remember when I was a student, and when we had an", 
    "after dinner speaker which we didn't like, we would all very", 
    "quickly empty our wine glasses-- in those days, we", 
    "were still allowed to drink, by the way.", 
    "And what we would do is the following,", 
    "something extremely annoying.", 
    "We would generate the", 
    "fundamental of our wine glasses.", 
    "You take your finger, you make it wet, and", 
    "you rub it like this.", 
    "Listen.", 
    "[HUMMING]", 
    "Believe me, if 100 students do that, it's very annoying, but", 
    "it's also extremely effective.", 
    "Speaker gets the message very quickly.", 
    "[HUMMING]", 
    "What the glass is doing, it is the fundamental of the glass.", 
    "It's the lowest frequency.", 
    "The glass is actually doing this.",

    "And they bragged about breaking glasses.", 
    "Some of you may actually have seen that commercial.", 
    "There was a picture that I can show you that goes with the", 
    "commercial, and then a very dramatic story.", 
    "The story is that someone goes to a concert, and there is a", 
    "woman singer.", 
    "Puts a glass on the table, raises her voice, hits the", 
    "resonance frequency of the glass, (PSHEW) and", 
    "there goes the glass.", 
    "And this gentleman was recording it, of course, on", 
    "his Memorex tape.", 
    "So let's see this slide.", 
    "So if we get the slides, yeah.", 
    "You see this glass.", 
    "Maybe you can focus a little better, John.", 
    "Thank you.", 
    "See Memorex.", 
    "So the story then goes that the guy goes home and tells", 
    "his wife about this.", 
    "Well, she is smart enough not to believe the story.", 
    "But he plays back his tape.", 
    "And at the moment that this glass breaks at the concert,", 
    "he has some wine glasses himself at home.", 
    "And lo and behold, they also break.", 
    "And so then, the idea is that is the commercial--", 
    "that's the great pitch of Memorex, that the reason why", 
    "they break at home is because of the enormous", 
    "quality of this tape.", 
    "Which is made of very special material.", 
    "And the material, as you could have read on the box, is a", 
    "very special chemical compound.", 
    "Is MRX2.", 
    "Two atoms of X, one of R, and one of M. And then you make it", 
    "oxide, and there you have the best tape that you can imagine", 
    "in the world.", 
    "Well, they overlooked a small detail, and that is that, for", 
    "one thing, a tape recorder would never generate enough", 
    "volume to break a glass in the first place.", 
    "But in the second place, the glasses that this guy had at", 
    "home obviously didn't have exactly the same resonance", 
    "frequency as the class at the concert.", 
    "So this could never have happened.", 
    "But like with all commercials, you know that", 
    "you're being swindled.", 
    "And this is, of course, no exception.", 
    "I've always questioned whether it is actually possible that a", 
    "person, without the aid of strong amplification, and", 
    "without the aid of huge sound volumes which you can generate", 
    "with loudspeakers, whether you can actually break a glass.", 
    "I've always wondered about that.", 
    "People say it can be done.", 
    "Caruso, famous singer, was known for", 
    "being able to do that.", 
    "He put a glass there.", 
    "He would rub it with his finger so that he knew the", 
    "resonance frequency.", 
    "[THHHT]", 
    "And there he would go and [PTTT]", 
    "bingo.", 
    "Frankly speaking, I don't believe it.", 
    "I don't believe it can be done by a human being without the", 
    "aid of amplifiers and speakers.", 
    "And when I lectured 8.01, several years ago, together", 
    "with Professor Feld here at MIT, we discussed the", 
    "possibility of designing something that actually would", 
    "be able to break a glass.", 
    "And he actually deserves a lot of credit for that.", 
    "He worked with a graduate student, and he managed to", 
    "design a setup that works most of the time.", 
    "But don't put your hopes too high.", 
    "It doesn't work all the time.", 
    "So here is a wine glass.", 
    "The same series as that one.", 
    "By the time, when he got it to work, we bought", 
    "500 of those glass.", 
    "We got a good discount, by the way, because we wanted to be", 
    "sure that we can do it for years to come.", 
    "So here is the wine glass, and here is the loudspeaker.", 
    "And we're going to generate sound very close to the", 
    "resonance frequency of this glass, which we have already", 
    "determined before you came in--", 
    "488 Hertz.", 
    "You're going to see the glass there.", 
    "And to make you see, actually, this wonderful motion of the", 
    "glass, we will strobe it with light at a frequency slightly", 
    "different from the frequency of the sound, so that you see", 
    "the glass move very slowly.", 
    "And then we will increase the volume of the speaker.", 
    "And then, with some luck, if we are right on resonance,", 
    "[PTTT!]", 
    "the glass may actually break.", 
    "I think this is the sound that you're going", 
    "to hear at low volume.", 
    "[HUMMING]", 
    "And I think I turned on the strobe light now.", 
    "So I'm going to go make it dark.", 
    "And I want to warn you that the sound level is going to be", 
    "quite high.", 
    "I will have to protect my ears, and you actually may", 
    "have to do the same.", 
    "I will first increase the volume of the sound to see", 
    "whether I'm close enough to resonance.", 
    "[HUMMING INCREASES]", 
    "So this slow motion that you see is the result of the", 
    "strobe, which is not exactly at the same", 
    "frequency as the glass.", 
    "I can change that a little.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So we are very close to resonance.", 
    "The glass is clearly responding to the sound.", 
    "And now I will cover my ears and slowly", 
    "increase the sound volume.", 
    "[HUMMING INCREASES SLOWLY]", 
    "It can't go any louder.", 
    "[HUMMING CONTINUES]", 
    "[GLASS BREAKING]", 
    "It was a tough glass.", 
    "[APPLAUSE]", 
    "I think you will probably agree with me now that for a", 
    "person to do that without electronic help is just not so", 
    "believable.", 
    "The most dramatic example of destructive resonance is the", 
    "collapse of the bridge, Tacoma, in 1940.", 
    "Many of you may have seen that dramatic movie, but some of", 
    "you may not have seen it.", 
    "And even if you have seen it, it's worth seeing it again.", 
    "There's a little bit of wind.", 
    "There's a little bit more wind.", 
    "And just like with these wind instruments, you're dumping a", 
    "whole spectrum of frequencies onto a wind instrument, and it", 
    "picks out the resonance frequency.", 
    "And this bridge, as you're going to see, picks out its", 
    "own resonance frequencies.", 
    "And the consequences are quite dramatic.", 
    "So if you can start, Marcos, with this movie.", 
    "[VIDEO PLAYBACK BEGINS]", 
    "-Dawn of a fateful day.", 
    "And the wind begins to speak with a roar that no man can", 
    "fail to hear.", 
    "In a 40-mile-an-hour gale, the center span weaves like a", 
    "ribbon in a swinging twist that you wouldn't believe", 
    "possible unless you could see it, as you do now.", 
    "There's an automobile caught on the heaving roadway.", 
    "The 11,000 ton center span twists and swings the giant", 
    "cables that support it.", 
    "Cables of 6,300 wire strands, each 17 inches thick.", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING AND WIND HOWLING]", 
    "No structure of steel and concrete can", 
    "stand such a strain.", 
    "Steel girders buckle and giant cables snap like puny threads.", 
    "There it goes!", 
    "[WIND HOWLING]", 
    "Engineers are divided as to the cause of the disaster.", 
    "Some claim it was the use of solid girders.", 
    "Others differ.", 
    "But whatever the reason, Tacoma will rebuild.", 
    "This time a bridge that will not provide a super", 
    "thrill in the news.", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]", 
    "No other example of destructive resonance is more", 
    "impressive than this one.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So now we've had so much fun, and we have to really get into", 
    "electromagnetic waves.", 
    "So we turn back to Maxwell's equations, as", 
    "you see them here.", 
    "And Maxwell, who was credited for this extra term that he", 
    "added to Ampere's Law, the displacement current term, was", 
    "able to predict that electromagnetic", 
    "waves should exist.", 
    "He predicted the existence of radio waves, which were later", 
    "discovered by Hertz.", 
    "And that was a great victory for the theory.", 
    "But as I will show you today, there was another enormous", 
    "victory around the corner.", 
    "Electric and magnetic fields can move through space, and", 
    "satisfy all four of Maxwell's equations.", 
    "The electric field results from a", 
    "changing magnetic field.", 
    "And a magnetic field results from a", 
    "changing electric field.", 
    "So one exists at the mercy of the other, and the other", 
    "exists at the mercy of one.", 
    "Together they propagate through space.", 
    "They can even propagate through vacuum, where there", 
    "are no charges, and where there are no currents.", 
    "Very mysterious.", 
    "I will write down a possible solution of an electromagnetic", 
    "wave which meets all four Maxwell's equations.", 
    "And this is the graphical display of those waves that", 
    "I'm going to write down.", 
    "But I will discuss that with you in a minute.", 
    "The electric field is only in the direction of x.", 
    "This is the magnitude, the largest value of", 
    "the electric field.", 
    "It's only in the direction of x.", 
    "Cosine k z minus omega t.", 
    "This is the frequency.", 
    "And the minus sign tells you that it is traveling in the", 
    "plus z direction.", 
    "B, the associated magnetic field, is B zero, only in the", 
    "y direction, with exactly the same cosine", 
    "minus omega t term."
