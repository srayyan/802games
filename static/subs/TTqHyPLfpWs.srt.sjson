    "WALTER LEWIN: Then I ask myself the question if that", 
    "photon is carried in a new direction, in what direction", 
    "is the E field oscillating?", 
    "And you'll come to exactly the same", 
    "conclusion, in this direction.", 
    "Why?", 
    "Because it has to be perpendicular", 
    "to r, which it is.", 
    "And it has to be in the plane of a and r.", 
    "That's the only solution.", 
    "A little later, there's another photon that comes in.", 
    "How is that electric field being observed here?", 
    "Of course, in this direction.", 
    "And so no matter how they come in, unpolarized light you will", 
    "always see that if the photon is scattered over 90 degrees", 
    "you will always see it polarized in this direction.", 
    "And therefore you have created linearly polarized light.", 
    "So if you watch here, there's a 90 degree angle or if you", 
    "watch here at 90 degree angles, but of course it's a", 
    "whole plane, then you end up with 100%", 
    "linearly polarized light.", 
    "If you go through the same exercise say at an angle here", 
    "of 45 degrees and you look here, it's", 
    "only partially polarized.", 
    "Indeed if you rotate in front of your eye a polarimeter, you", 
    "will see clearly light intensity changes, but not", 
    "100% polarized.", 
    "You couldn't turn it into darkness.", 
    "And if you look from above--", 
    "and you may want to go through that exercise for yourself--", 
    "you will see that the light remains completely", 
    "unpolarized.", 
    "So it is only the 90 degree angle that is very special.", 
    "And that's what I'm going to demonstrate to you.", 
    "But before I demonstrate it, there is something that I have", 
    "to tell you, that I cannot hide from you.", 
    "I wish I could, but I can't.", 
    "It's not something that is my goal during this lecture.", 
    "It has nothing to do with polarization.", 
    "But it's the fact that the probability when you scatter", 
    "light of very small particles, much smaller than 1/10 of", 
    "micron or so, dust particles, the probability of scattering", 
    "is way higher for blue light than it is for red light.", 
    "The shorter the wavelengths the higher the probability.", 
    "If you ever take 8.03, you're going to see a derivation of", 
    "that, the quantitative derivation.", 
    "Blue light has a seven times higher probability to be", 
    "scattered then red light.", 
    "And so whenever I'm going to do my scatter experiments on", 
    "very fine particles, you will see that that light is going", 
    "to be bluish.", 
    "You can't miss that.", 
    "Now if the particles of which I scatter are larger than the", 
    "a tenth of a micron--", 
    "say 1 micron--", 
    "this effect of color on probability of scattering is", 
    "highly reduced.", 
    "And if I scatter off very large particles, then there is", 
    "no dependence anymore at all.", 
    "And in this lies the secret why the sky is blue--", 
    "I will get back to that later today--", 
    "the reason why cigarette smoke can be blue if the smoke", 
    "particles are very small, and it's the reason why clouds are", 
    "white because the sunlight hits the clouds, light", 
    "scatters, but the water drops in the cloud are several", 
    "microns in size and even larger.", 
    "And so there is no preferred wave length that scatters, and", 
    "so the clouds look white.", 
    "And so the first demonstration that I want to do is very much", 
    "like what you see here.", 
    "I'm going to send unpolarized light up here straight up.", 
    "We have bright spotlights there, and the light goes", 
    "straight up.", 
    "In here, I'm going to put very small dust particles.", 
    "And I have decided to do that smoke, simply cigarette smoke.", 
    "So I'm going to hold cigarette smoke in these beams.", 
    "And the light that will come to you no matter where you sit", 
    "must have scattered closely over 90 degrees.", 
    "Right?", 
    "It comes up like this.", 
    "But if you see it, almost for everyone in the audience 90", 
    "degree angle scattering.", 
    "So with your linear polarizers, you will be able", 
    "to see that that light is polarized.", 
    "And it's going to be polarized in this direction, which is", 
    "the direction that I have here.", 
    "So that's the first thing I'm going to do for this", 
    "demonstration.", 
    "So I need cigarettes, and I need smoke, as", 
    "much as I hate this.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "Ahh.", 
    "OK.", 
    "That should do.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "OK.", 
    "So you need a lot of lights.", 
    "And this light comes presumably from here.", 
    "Yeah.", 
    "There it is.", 
    "Ahh.", 
    "Ready for this?", 
    "OK.", 
    "So have your polarizers ready.", 
    "I want you to see two things.", 
    "Number one that the light is bluish.", 
    "And number two that it is polarized.", 
    "Take your time for that.", 
    "If you don't see it as blue, then the reason for that is", 
    "that at low-light intensities your eyes are not very", 
    "sensitive for color anymore.", 
    "It looks quite bluish to me though.", 
    "Now I want to do something in addition.", 
    "I mentioned that if the particles grow in size that", 
    "the scattering is no longer preferred in the blue.", 
    "And I can demonstrate that.", 
    "I can kill two birds with one stone.", 
    "What I can do is I can hold the smoke in", 
    "my lungs for a while.", 
    "And when I do that, the water vapor in my lungs will", 
    "precipitate on these dust particles, and they will form", 
    "small water drops.", 
    "And when I puff that out, you will see a distinct difference", 
    "in color between what you see now and the smoke that comes", 
    "out of my lungs when these particles are 10 microns and", 
    "even larger.", 
    "You will see then that the light is whitish.", 
    "So this comes extra, over and above.", 
    "This comes for free.", 
    "In order to make you see the difference, shortly before I", 
    "puff out the smoke in here I will again show you this smoke", 
    "as it is now, so you can compare the color.", 
    "And you will see that there is a difference even though it", 
    "may not look very bluish to you for", 
    "reasons that I mentioned.", 
    "In darkness, you don't have a very good", 
    "sensitivity for color.", 
    "So I'm going to hold this smoke now as", 
    "much as I hate it.", 
    "This is one of the worst demonstrations", 
    "that I have to do.", 
    "I hold it in my lungs for awhile.", 
    "I see a huge difference, but I'm very close.", 
    "The second puff [INHALES]", 
    "[EXHALES]", 
    "was very white compared to the first.", 
    "So we were able to catch two birds with one stone here.", 
    "The sky is blue because of this phenomenon.", 
    "Here you are standing innocently on the Earth.", 
    "And sunlight is coming in onto the Earth's atmosphere.", 
    "The sun is there.", 
    "The sunlight comes in, and the light scatters.", 
    "And the light that reaches you, that scatters off these", 
    "extremely fine dust particles, and it also scatters off the", 
    "air molecules themselves, there are thermal fluctuations", 
    "that go on all the time which causes density", 
    "fluctuations in the air.", 
    "And they are sufficient to act as scatterers.", 
    "And so if light from here comes to you, the chances are", 
    "that it is blue because it has a higher probability than red.", 
    "And this is also likely to be blue.", 
    "And so when you look at the sky, this sky looks blue.", 
    "That's the reason.", 
    "It has to do with this strong preference for color to be", 
    "scattered when it is blue light.", 
    "If you look in the direction of the sky at an angle of 90", 
    "degrees to the direction of the sun, the sky is also", 
    "linearly polarized for the reason that we now understand", 
    "because they are scattering over 90 degrees.", 
    "And so when the sun is out there, there is always a whole", 
    "plane, a great circle in the sky, which is 90 degrees away", 
    "from the sun.", 
    "So when you come out with your linear polarizers, as soon as", 
    "the weather clears look at the sky, at the blue sky, and look", 
    "90 degrees away from the sun.", 
    "And you will see that the sky is very strongly polarized.", 
    "If you look at the angles different from 90 degrees,", 
    "it's partially polarized but not as strongly polarized as", 
    "it is at 90 degrees.", 
    "So this explains in a very natural way why the sun when", 
    "it rises and why the sun when it sets why the sun is red.", 
    "Because if the sun rises or the sun sets, the sun is near", 
    "the horizon.", 
    "So now the sunlight comes in like this.", 
    "Imagine how much atmosphere it has to travel through, how", 
    "many scattering particles it will encounter on the way.", 
    "And so right here, there is scattering that is blue light,", 
    "that is blue light, that is blue light, that is blue", 
    "light, that has a higher probability", 
    "that it's blue light.", 
    "So what do you think is left over for you?", 
    "There isn't very much leftover.", 
    "What is left over, the blue is gone, the green is gone.", 
    "So if there's anything left over, it is red.", 
    "And it is that red light that you see.", 
    "That's why the sun looks red when it sets and it looks red", 
    "when it rises.", 
    "The same is true for planets and bright stars and the moon.", 
    "When they're just above the horizon,", 
    "they look very reddish.", 
    "And there happens to be a cloud here in the sky, well,", 
    "the cloud will also see that red light, so", 
    "you get a red cloud.", 
    "And that's exactly what you see at sunset.", 
    "All these clouds turn red.", 
    "And so that is, again, the consequence of the fact that", 
    "the probability for light scattering of blue light is", 
    "seven times larger roughly than the", 
    "scattering for red light.", 
    "So it explains both the blue skies and the reason why the", 
    "sunrise and the sunset are red.", 
    "I can show you two slides whereby you do see this", 
    "phenomenon that lights that scatters", 
    "to you becomes bluish.", 
    "We can see it in astronomy.", 
    "And the first slide is a picture of the Pleiades,", 
    "called the Seven Sisters, very hot stars.", 
    "They are surrounded by very small fine dust.", 
    "And the light that reaches you is not only polarized, which", 
    "you cannot see of course on the slide,", 
    "but it's also bluish.", 
    "And so let's take a look at that first.", 
    "So here you see the Pleiades.", 
    "It's called the Seven Sisters.", 
    "Some people think there are only seven stars in there, but", 
    "there are hundreds.", 
    "And you see here these very bright stars.", 
    "And here you see the dust surrounding these stars, and", 
    "it is distinctly blue.", 
    "That's the effect, the effect that short wavelengths have a", 
    "higher probability to be scattered than long", 
    "wavelengths.", 
    "So the blue has a higher probability than the red.", 
    "And the next slide shows you a man on the moon.", 
    "And this person is walking on the moon, but as he walks on", 
    "the moon, he produces dust by just walking, very fine dust", 
    "particles that come from the soil that he brings up.", 
    "And what he is doing he is creating around himself sort", 
    "of a blue atmosphere, a blue sky, because the sunlight", 
    "comes from the right.", 
    "And so the light that you see that comes in your direction", 
    "is being scattered, of course, because there is", 
    "no air on the moon.", 
    "So it can only be the dust that he has produced.", 
    "And you see that that dust is blue.", 
    "Will probably also be strongly polarized.", 
    "Because if it changes 90 degrees angle, then of course", 
    "it would also be strongly polarized.", 
    "Now I want to do a demonstration, the last one,", 
    "which catches more than two birds with one stone.", 
    "It's going to kill three.", 
    "I have here a bucket with thiosulfate.", 
    "And we have light coming from this side, which we shine", 
    "through that bucket.", 
    "And we're going to put a little bit of", 
    "sulfuric acid in there.", 
    "And when we do that, sulfur will precipitate, small", 
    "particles of sulfur.", 
    "These small particles of sulfur will become the", 
    "scatterers.", 
    "And so this light, which is unpolarized white light, will", 
    "begin to scatter.", 
    "And you're going to see it.", 
    "If you're sitting at right angles, then you will see that", 
    "that light is linearly polarized.", 
    "You can enjoy that.", 
    "If you're sitting there, you're not so well off because", 
    "then the light is not at 90 degrees, but you will see it", 
    "partially polarized.", 
    "If you're sitting there, it's not at 90 degrees either.", 
    "You will see it partially polarized.", 
    "But you will also see it blue because the probability that", 
    "blue light scatters is higher than red light.", 
    "So you're going to see slowly in front of your eye a blue", 
    "sky is going to develop.", 
    "It's going to be polarized in the vertical direction for", 
    "those people who are sitting at right angles, partially", 
    "polarized for the rest of the audience.", 
    "And then we're going to look at the light that remains", 
    "after the light has penetrated the atmosphere, after the blue", 
    "light is slowly exhausted.", 
    "All right.", 
    "I will also take a polarizer with me, so I can also show", 
    "you then the polarization.", 
    "Let me first put that sulfuric acid in.", 
    "I will do that now so that I know that I--", 
    "OK.", 
    "So very slowly am I creating now my own atmosphere.", 
    "And I'm going to make it completely dark.", 
    "And so you see white light.", 
    "Keep an eye on the bucket.", 
    "The bucket cannot be seen by all of us so well depending", 
    "upon where you sit in the audience.", 
    "But I can already begin to see that it", 
    "turned slightly bluish.", 
    "Of course, I'm very close.", 
    "I admit I'm very close, which is very good.", 
    "It's slightly bluish.", 
    "More and more sulfur is going to precipitate", 
    "as time goes on.", 
    "We have to be a little patient.", 
    "Oh boy, it's bluish.", 
    "I will show you that it's polarized.", 
    "I will rotate in front of it a polarimeter.", 
    "You see there's a distinct polarization of this light if", 
    "it comes out at 90 degrees.", 
    "More and more sulfur is precipitating.", 
    "And look at the sun, if you think of this as the sun.", 
    "The sun is getting a little yellowish.", 
    "It's not so white anymore.", 
    "And you wonder why?", 
    "Well, you should be able to answer that now.", 
    "Because the light that is scattered in the atmosphere--", 
    "and I call this the atmosphere--", 
    "is blue.", 
    "It has a higher probability than red.", 
    "And so what is left over in the direction that you see on", 
    "the screen there is the remaining light.", 
    "And the more blue leaves and the more green leaves, the", 
    "redder the sun is going to be.", 
    "And if we're going to be a little bit more patient, and", 
    "we certainly have the time for that, you're going to see the", 
    "sun getting pretty, pretty bloody red.", 
    "So keep an eye on it.", 
    "Also have your linear polarizers and try to see that", 
    "the light that comes to you from the atmosphere if you are", 
    "at 90 degree angles--", 
    "I will once more do it with my polarizers--", 
    "that it's strongly polarized.", 
    "Oh boy, and look at the sun.", 
    "We're getting close.", 
    "We're getting close.", 
    "[WHISTLES]", 
    "Imagine you're now on the beach, very romantic, and", 
    "there is the sun.", 
    "You're with a friend.", 
    "You don't have your polarizer--", 
    "from now on, you should always have your", 
    "polarizer with you of course.", 
    "You can really impress your friend.", 
    "Believe me.", 
    "For one thing, you can point out that the sky at 90 degree", 
    "angles from the sun is nearly 100% polarized.", 
    "You could even tell your friend why the sky is blue.", 
    "And then as you experience this romantic sunset, you", 
    "could also explain why the sun is getting red because all", 
    "that blue light and the green light gets out first.", 
    "And this is then what is left over.", 
    "And the sun is really beautiful now.", 
    "I already feel these butterflies in my stomach and", 
    "ants in my pants.", 
    "This is sunset all right.",
