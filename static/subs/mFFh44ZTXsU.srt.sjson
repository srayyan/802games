    "WALTER LEWIN: With these three values, I can", 
    "calculate what the Z is.", 
    "And Z is 300 ohms.", 
    "In case you're interested, I can also give you omega L,", 
    "that is 38 ohms.", 
    "And I can give you 1 over omega C, that is 332 ohms.", 
    "So notice that this is by far the dominant player in the", 
    "game compared to omega L. In case you're interested in the", 
    "resonance frequency, omega 0 is 1 over the square root of L", 
    "C. And that is about 1,120 radians per second.", 
    "In other words, my driver is no where near resonance.", 
    "I am way below resonance.", 
    "When you're way below resonance, it", 
    "is the C that dominates.", 
    "Look at the 332 ohms and compare that with the 38.", 
    "I can calculate now what the maximum current is that we", 
    "get, I max.", 
    "That is V 0 divided by Z, that impedance.", 
    "So that is 110 square root 2 divided by 300 ohms.", 
    "And that is 0.5 amperes.", 
    "And now I can tell you how much power is dissipated in", 
    "the light bulb which is I squared R. So in the light", 
    "bulb, which is the only component which has a", 
    "resistance--", 
    "well maybe the L has also a little bit of resistance, but", 
    "we will ignore that for now.", 
    "So in the light bulb, the average power over one full", 
    "cycle of my oscillations equals the mean value between", 
    "I squared R, time average.", 
    "The time average value of cosine omega t squared is", 
    "always one half.", 
    "So this one half that comes here is the result of the fact", 
    "that the I there has a cosine omega t and you square that,", 
    "you get one half if you average it over oscillations.", 
    "And so now I get I max squared times R. So this is one half", 
    "times my 0.5 squared.", 
    "And the R of the light bulb is 60.", 
    "And this turns out to be 7.5 watts.", 
    "Nothing.", 
    "Why is it nothing?", 
    "Well that's the way we designed the system.", 
    "We're way below resonance.", 
    "So if I plug the system in, which I will do for you, this", 
    "200 watt light bulb will only dissipate 7.5 watts, and you", 
    "won't see anything.", 
    "You ready for this?", 
    "Three, two, one, zero.", 
    "Physics works.", 
    "You see nothing.", 
    "Light bulb not working.", 
    "Great.", 
    "So now comes the question, what could we do to get the", 
    "system back on resonance?", 
    "Well we know that our driving frequency is", 
    "377 radians per second.", 
    "And so what we could do, we could change the C in the", 
    "circuit and we could change L in the circuit.", 
    "If we increase C or we increase L then the resonance", 
    "frequency will shift from 1120 down, make L larger or make C", 
    "larger then obviously you shift your", 
    "resonance frequency down.", 
    "And my goal is to shift it down to", 
    "377 radians per second.", 
    "I first want to make a curve for you here very roughly of I", 
    "max as a function of frequency omega.", 
    "And that's the demonstration I just did when this was 1120.", 
    "We have about 0.5 amperes at our value of 377.", 
    "So this is one point of our I max versus omega curve.", 
    "I can now ask the question, if we drive the system at", 
    "resonance, what then would have been the maximum curve?", 
    "We're not driving it at resonance, but suppose we had", 
    "driven it at resonance?", 
    "Well at resonance, I max is V 0 divided by R. There is no", 
    "self inductor.", 
    "And there is no capacitance at resonance.", 
    "And so that would then be 110 square root of", 
    "2 divided by 60.", 
    "But that is 2.6 amperes.", 
    "That is substantially larger than one half.", 
    "So this value here is 2.6 amperes.", 
    "It is too bad that I can't go there because I am stuck to my", 
    "377 and I'm not going to change that.", 
    "Throughout the demonstration, I stick to my driver here.", 
    "So keep in mind that the driver is always here.", 
    "I don't change that.", 
    "So the resonance curve--", 
    "we call this the resonance curve-- is very broad.", 
    "Something like this.", 
    "And I believe the Q is around 2, you can", 
    "check that for yourself.", 
    "I can calculate what the power is, that the bulb is", 
    "dissipating at resonance.", 
    "Well that is my one half, which is the time average", 
    "cosine squared.", 
    "My I max is now 2.6 amperes.", 
    "So now I got 2.6 squared.", 
    "And my resistance is still 60 ohms.", 
    "And this is 200 watts.", 
    "What a coincidence.", 
    "That's the way we designed the experiment.", 
    "So if we could be at resonance, the light bulb", 
    "would be happy like a clam at high tides.", 
    "It's exactly 200 watts.", 
    "It wants 2.6 amperes.", 
    "That's what it wants.", 
    "Then it is a 200-watt light bulb.", 
    "And so we want to make the light bulb happy.", 
    "And how can we do that?", 
    "Well we can either increase L or we can increase C. And I", 
    "want to catch two birds with one stone doing this", 
    "demonstration.", 
    "I'm going to teach you a way that you can increase L,", 
    "something that we have never discussed before.", 
    "I have here ferromagnetic material which has a value for", 
    "kappa somewhere around 10, 12.", 
    "Let's say it is 10 for now.", 
    "So that means that if I bring that iron core inside that I", 
    "could make this go up to 1 Henry.", 
    "Because remember, the meaning of self-inductance is the flux", 
    "divided by the current in the solenoid.", 
    "And so if you bring in ferromagnetic material with a", 
    "kappa M of 10, then the flux goes up by a factor of 10.", 
    "The current remains the same.", 
    "And therefore, your self-inductance goes up by a", 
    "factor of 10.", 
    "So you see that you can make a variable self-inductance by", 
    "bringing in ferromagnetic material and", 
    "by removing it again.", 
    "And so the question now is how high should L", 
    "be to get on resonance?", 
    "Well that's very easy.", 
    "Because we know that 1 over the square root of L C, we", 
    "want to make that 377.", 
    "That's our driver.", 
    "But we know that C is 8 microfarads.", 
    "That's a god given.", 
    "We're not going to change that.", 
    "And so you can easily show now that if only we could make L", 
    "0.88 Henry, we should be back on resonance.", 
    "Then we have 377 radians per second as our resonance.", 
    "And you shouldn't be surprised that omega L is then 332 ohms.", 
    "Of course it is 332 ohms.", 
    "Because it's going to eat up that 1 over omega C. They're", 
    "going to cancel each other.", 
    "That's another way that you could have calculated the", 
    "value of L, by simply saying omega L has to be 332.", 
    "So there are various ways to get your resonance frequency.", 
    "And so what I have done, if I make L 0.88 Henry, I shift the", 
    "resonance frequency to this value.", 
    "And my resonance curves now will look like this.", 
    "But this height is going to be the same.", 
    "Because the height is only determined by V 0 and R. And", 
    "so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to turn on the", 
    "instrument where it was before.", 
    "When this was the resonance curve, you won't see any", 
    "light, and going to move the bar in.", 
    "I probably don't have to move it in all the way.", 
    "And then the light bulb will go through resonance.", 
    "The system will go through resonance.", 
    "You will get your 2.6 amperes and the light", 
    "bulb will be happy.", 
    "And so let's do that now.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So here the system is now--", 
    "current is going.", 
    "60 hertz, 110 volts, root mean square, as we call that.", 
    "And it's way off resonance, 7.5 watts.", 
    "The light bulb doesn't even feel warm.", 
    "And now I bring this enormous piece of iron in there.", 
    "And when I shove it in, the self inductance will slowly go", 
    "up, the resonance frequency will shift, and the current", 
    "through the system will increase.", 
    "And there we go.", 
    "And there it is.", 
    "I'm on resonance now.", 
    "So the light bulb is quite happy.", 
    "I want to do one more thing.", 
    "I'm going to double the capacitance."
