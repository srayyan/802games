    "ferromagnetic material, could be a wrench.", 
    "What happens now is that this ferromagnetic material will", 
    "see this vacuum field.", 
    "This is called a vacuum field, an external field.", 
    "And so these domains in there trying to line a little bit.", 
    "The degree of success depends on how strong the field is,", 
    "depends on the temperature, it depends on the", 
    "kappa M of that material.", 
    "But certainly this will become sort of a south pole.", 
    "This will become a north pole.", 
    "That's the way that these dipoles are going to align", 
    "themselves.", 
    "They are going to create themselves a", 
    "field in this direction.", 
    "They're going to support that field.", 
    "And so the net result is that the field inside here becomes", 
    "very strong.", 
    "And so what happens with these field lines,", 
    "they go like this.", 
    "They are being sucked into this ferromagnetic material.", 
    "It's very hard to know exactly how they go.", 
    "And the field here will weaken.", 
    "And I am going to demonstrate that to you.", 
    "This is actually very easy to demonstrate.", 
    "And the way I'm going to", 
    "demonstrate that is as follows.", 
    "I have there a set up whereby we have a magnet", 
    "and we have a nail.", 
    "And we have a string.", 
    "And the nail wants to go to the magnet.", 
    "The nail itself is ferromagnetic.", 
    "So the nail would love to go in this", 
    "direction, but it can't.", 
    "So it just sits there.", 
    "It hangs there in space.", 
    "First of all, what I want to show you is that if I bring", 
    "paramagnetic material in the vicinity, that that magnetic", 
    "field configuration here is not going to change at all.", 
    "Paramagnetic material has a kappa of M so close to 1 that", 
    "nothing is going to happen.", 
    "But the moment that I bring ferromagnetic material for", 
    "instance here, then you get a field configuration change.", 
    "And if I do that just the right way, then", 
    "the nail will fall.", 
    "In other words, there is not enough magnetic field here in", 
    "order to hold the nail in that direction.", 
    "And I'm going to show that to you there.", 
    "Need some power here, I believe.", 
    "And we have to make it dark here.", 
    "We're going to shadow project it for you.", 
    "And the shadow projection you will see", 
    "coming up very shortly.", 
    "It's a carbon arc.", 
    "You have to give a little bit of time to start.", 
    "There's the carbon arc.", 
    "But there, you see the nail.", 
    "You see the magnets.", 
    "You see that?", 
    "It's exactly the way I drew the picture.", 
    "And here, I have here a piece of aluminum which is", 
    "paramagnetic.", 
    "I can bring that through the field here.", 
    "Nothing happens.", 
    "My hands, believe it or not, are definitely not", 
    "ferromagnetic.", 
    "So I can also bring my hands here.", 
    "Nothing.", 
    "So magnetic field is not disturbed in any way, in any", 
    "serious way, either by paramagnetic material,", 
    "aluminum, or my hands, which I think are also paramagnetic.", 
    "But I'm not sure.", 
    "I'm not sure whether I'm diamagnetic or paramagnetic,", 
    "but it doesn't make any difference.", 
    "Because in both cases, there is no significant change of", 
    "the magnetic field.", 
    "But now I have a wrench here.", 
    "Here, there's a wrench.", 
    "You see it?", 
    "OK.", 
    "And now I bring the wrench close to that magnet.", 
    "My major worry is that magnetic field is so strong,", 
    "that once the wrench goes, there's no way I", 
    "can get it off again.", 
    "So I get only one shot at it.", 
    "And there goes the nail.", 
    "So what you saw now in front of your own eyes is that I", 
    "changed the magnetic field configuration in such a way", 
    "that the field was not strong enough to pull in the nail.", 
    "Now comes an important question, a big", 
    "moment in our life.", 
    "And that is what now is the effect of magnetic material on", 
    "Maxwell's equations?", 
    "And let's take a look at Maxwell's equations.", 
    "Here we have Maxwell's equations", 
    "the way we know them.", 
    "And let's first look at number one.", 
    "That's Gauss's law.", 
    "Gauss's law says that the closed surface integral E dot", 
    "dA, that's the electric flux through a closed surface, is", 
    "equal to all the charge inside divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "But you have to allow for the kappa, for the electric", 
    "dielectric constant.", 
    "The kappa, by the way, always lowers the field inside the", 
    "material when we deal with electric fields.", 
    "It never increases it like magnetic fields.", 
    "It always lowers it.", 
    "Kappa is normally a few--", 
    "except for water which is 80, it's quite large.", 
    "And there are some ridiculous substances whereby kappa can", 
    "be as large as 300.", 
    "I think strontium titanate--", 
    "I just looked it up this morning--", 
    "has a ridiculous value of kappa of 300.", 
    "So that's Gauss's law.", 
    "Nothing's going to change there, as far as I can see.", 
    "And then we have the second one.", 
    "The closed surface integral of B dot dl equals 0.", 
    "Oh, it says an l.", 
    "That shouldn't even be an l.", 
    "Oh!", 
    "I hope you caught that.", 
    "This is an A, of course.", 
    "How could I?", 
    "This is the closed surface integral of B dot dA is 0--", 
    "what this is telling me is that magnetic", 
    "monopoles don't exist.", 
    "At least we think they don't exist.", 
    "Don't think that people are not trying to find them.", 
    "And if you find a magnetic monopole and if you put that", 
    "inside a box, then the closed surface integral of the", 
    "magnetic flux through that box would not be 0.", 
    "And so then this is not true.", 
    "But as far as we know, it's always true.", 
    "Because we don't think that magnetic poles--", 
    "monopoles-- exist.", 
    "And so then we come to be Faraday's law.", 
    "Faraday's law runs our economy.", 
    "Faraday's law tells you when you move conducting loops in", 
    "magnetic fields that you create electricity.", 
    "This equation runs our economy.", 
    "And now we come-- none of these, by the way, require any", 
    "adjustment in terms of kappa of M. But now we come to", 
    "Ampere's law.", 
    "Ampere's law, which was amended by Maxwell himself,", 
    "tells me what a magnetic field is and all these results are", 
    "for vacuum.", 
    "But now we know that that's not true anymore.", 
    "So this has to be adjusted now by a factor of kappa of M,", 
    "which is the relative permeability.", 
    "And kappa of M is perfectly kosher for paramagnetic and", 
    "diamagnetic materials.", 
    "There's never any problem there.", 
    "So here it comes.", 
    "For diamagnetic materials, it's a little less than 1, for", 
    "paramagnetic materials, a little larger than 1.", 
    "But when we deal with ferromagnetic materials, you", 
    "have to be very careful.", 
    "Because we have seen today this hysteresis phenomenon", 
    "that there are even situations whereby kappa of M is negative", 
    "whereby kappa M is 0 and whereby kappa M can be huge,", 
    "can be 10 to the third.", 
    "So there, you have to be very, very careful when you apply", 
    "this equation without thinking.", 
    "Maxwell's equations are so important that I'm sure you", 
    "want to see more of them.", 
    "So you see them there again.", 
    "And maybe that's not enough.", 
    "Maybe you want to see even more of them.", 
    "So look at them.", 
    "Inhale them.", 
    "Let them penetrate your brains.", 
    "I don't care in which direction you look now.", 
    "It's hard not to see them.", 
    "Today is therefore very special.", 
    "Because today, we have all four Maxwell's", 
    "equations in place.", 
    "And this was one of the main objectives of 8.02 So we have", 
    "completed a long journey.", 
    "And on April 5, we have reached the summit.", 
    "Now, I realize that the view is not spectacular", 
    "for all of you yet.", 
    "Because often at the summit there is some fog.", 
    "But the fog will clear.", 
    "And I can assure you that from here on,", 
    "it's climbing downhill.", 
    "I think this moment is worth celebrating.", 
    "And therefore, I bought 600 daffodils for this occasion.", 
    "And I would like you to come at the end of the lecture and", 
    "pick up one of these daffodils and take it", 
    "back to your dormitory.", 
    "I don't know that I have enough for all these high", 
    "school students and all their parents.", 
    "But why not?", 
    "Give it a shot and take one.", 
    "And when you look at it tonight at home and tomorrow,", 
    "remember that you only once in your life go through this", 
    "experience, that for the first time you see all four", 
    "Maxwell's equations complete.", 
    "Hold it.", 
    "And that you're capable of appreciating", 
    "them, at least in principle.", 
    "This will never happen again.", 
    "You will never be the same.", 
    "To put it in simple terms, as far as 8.02 is concerned, you", 
    "are no longer unspoiled virginal material.", 
    "You've lost your virginity, congratulations!", 
    "[APPLAUSE]"
