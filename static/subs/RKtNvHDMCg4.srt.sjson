    "WALTER LEWIN: And I now use the superposition principle.", 
    "I say to myself, aha, this plate alone--", 
    "forget this one.", 
    "This plate alone would give me E vector.", 
    "Oh, stick to my colors.", 
    "Give me an E vector like so.", 
    "And that is sigma divided by 2 epsilon 0.", 
    "This one is also pointing away from this--", 
    "sigma divided by 2 epsilon 0.", 
    "And here, it's also sigma divided by 2 epsilon 0,", 
    "because it's independent of the distance to this place.", 
    "What is the negative charge doing?", 
    "Well, the negative charge has E vectors pointing towards it.", 
    "So here, I have an E vector, which is sigma divided", 
    "by 2 epsilon 0.", 
    "Here I have one that is sigma divided by 2 epsilon 0.", 
    "And I have one that's pointing towards the plate, which is", 
    "sigma divided by 2 epsilon 0.", 
    "I use the superposition principle.", 
    "I can add the electric vectors, and when I do that, I", 
    "find that these two cancel each other out.", 
    "So the electric field here is 0.", 
    "The electric field here is sigma divided by epsilon 0.", 
    "The two support each other.", 
    "They are both in the same direction.", 
    "And the electric field here is again 0.", 
    "And that is an amazing result.", 
    "Of course, it's only accurate if these plates are", 
    "extraordinarily large.", 
    "And so if I have to draw the field lines in the situation", 
    "like this, then the field lines would be like so.", 
    "If the upper plate is positive and the field in here would be", 
    "the same everywhere, the outside's 0", 
    "and outside's 0 here.", 
    "Now, clearly this cannot be true if you get into this area", 
    "here, where you are near the end of these plates.", 
    "That is not possible.", 
    "Why not?", 
    "Well, you can't use your symmetry argument.", 
    "So Gauss's law is not going to help you if you get anywhere", 
    "near this area.", 
    "And it is very difficult to calculate the electric field", 
    "configuration when you are near the edges, which we call", 
    "the fringe field.", 
    "Maxwell, of course, was a clever man.", 
    "And he knew how to do that.", 
    "Today, we can also do that very easily with computers.", 
    "But I'll show you, from Maxwell's original", 
    "publications, that in a situation like that, he was", 
    "already perfectly capable of calculating these electric", 
    "field lines.", 
    "Now, you have these two horizontal plates.", 
    "Which one is plus and which one is minus doesn't matter.", 
    "He doesn't put arrows in there.", 
    "And what you see is an extremely strong field inside", 
    "the two plates.", 
    "Remember that the density of field lines tells you", 
    "something about very strong fields, but when you get near", 
    "the edge, the field is not really 0.", 
    "The field strength drops very rapidly, because look, the", 
    "density is very low.", 
    "But it is not 0.", 
    "And the electric field is not 0 here, either,", 
    "and is not 0 there.", 
    "In our assumption, in our simplification, we have,", 
    "however, assumed that the plate is so large that we", 
    "don't have to worry about any end effects.", 
    "And in that case, the electric field is only existent in", 
    "between the plates, but not anywhere else.", 
    "I now want to demonstrate to you some of the things that we", 
    "have learned today.", 
    "And the first thing that I want to demonstrate is that", 
    "the electric field outside a large plane is", 
    "more or less constant.", 
    "It doesn't matter how far away you are.", 
    "Now, the way I'm going to do that is-- of course I don't", 
    "have an infinite large plane.", 
    "The plane that you're going to see, only a few", 
    "square meters in size.", 
    "And so if it's only something like 1 by 1 meter, then it", 
    "would only be true that the electric field is very close", 
    "to constant if I stay very close to that plane.", 
    "The moment that I go out as far as a meter, of course,", 
    "it's no longer true.", 
    "So it's very qualitative, what I'm going to show you.", 
    "But you're going to see very shortly there", 
    "a very large plane.", 
    "We're going to get it in a few minutes.", 
    "And let's assume that we look at that plane edge on.", 
    "So here is that plane.", 
    "Look at it from edge on.", 
    "It will be put here.", 
    "It will block your view.", 
    "That's why we don't have it up now.", 
    "And what I will do now is I will connect that with the Van", 
    "de Graaff, which is behind this.", 
    "If you wait a few minutes, then the class will pay", 
    "attention to me and not to you.", 
    "Here's the Van de Graaff.", 
    "We're going to attach it to the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And then we use this interesting fishing rod, which", 
    "is a small mylar balloon, which we will charge with the", 
    "same charge as the Van de Graaff, with the same charge", 
    "as the plate.", 
    "And we will hold that in front of the plane.", 
    "And then, of course, there will be a force.", 
    "So here is my glass rod.", 
    "This is the vertical.", 
    "And because there will be repelling force on this", 
    "airfield balloon, there will be an angle.", 
    "There's an electric force on it because the two have the", 
    "same charge.", 
    "And this is the angle theta that I will show you projected", 
    "on that wall.", 
    "And when I move this away from this plane, you will see that", 
    "the angle theta becomes smaller.", 
    "Yes, of course, because look how small that plane is.", 
    "No matter what I do, if I go from 20 to 40 centimeters, you", 
    "can't really say that the plane is infinitely large", 
    "compared to 40 centimeters.", 
    "But you will see that the angle of theta will change", 
    "very slowly.", 
    "And then we will remove that plane.", 
    "And then we will do exactly the same experiment, but we", 
    "will use only the Van de Graaff, which produces now an", 
    "electric field.", 
    "And that electric field now falls off as 1 over R squared.", 
    "It's not constant as a function of distance, but it", 
    "falls off as 1 over R squared.", 
    "This is a hollow sphere.", 
    "So you can think of it as all the charge right at the", 
    "center, as we demonstrated.", 
    "So on the blackboard still here--", 
    "you get that amazing result.", 
    "And so now, if I place this fishing rod, this balloon,", 
    "near the spherical Van de Graaff, you will see that this", 
    "angle theta drops very fast when I start", 
    "moving my hand away--", 
    "extraordinarily fast.", 
    "If I double the distance to the center, the force on that", 
    "little object will become four times smaller.", 
    "It's inverse R squared.", 
    "So let's first do the plane.", 
    "And then we'll try to do the single Van de Graaff.", 
    "And we'll try to optimize the light conditions.", 
    "We have a projection here.", 
    "There's a carbon arc, which will hopefully produce some", 
    "light in that direction, if the carbon arc works.", 
    "Oh, I forgot to turn on the power.", 
    "Thank you.", 
    "So this carbon arc is coming on.", 
    "And you will see there the shadows on that wall.", 
    "You see my hands.", 
    "Here is that plane.", 
    "And it is far from infinitely large, that plane.", 
    "If I were this far away from it--", 
    "4 centimeters--", 
    "very close approximation.", 
    "It will be infinitely large.", 
    "But if I'm here and there-- and that's where I will be, of", 
    "course-- it is not infinitely large anymore.", 
    "So let's start the Van de Graaff.", 
    "You can't see, but I turn it on.", 
    "It's rotating now.", 
    "I have to put charge on here, so I'll touch it", 
    "with the Van de Graaff.", 
    "And so this is now charged.", 
    "It has the same charge as the plane.", 
    "The plane is being charged.", 
    "And here, you see the angle.", 
    "Try to remember that angle.", 
    "It's hard to estimate-- maybe 15 degrees.", 
    "You see the vertical.", 
    "It's about 30 centimeters away from the plane.", 
    "And if now I go back to 50 centimeters--", 
    "this is where I am now--", 
    "you see the angle hasn't changed very much.", 
    "If I go further out to 60 centimeters, yeah, the angle", 
    "goes down a little.", 
    "Of course it does--", 
    "but not very much.", 
    "And if I go far away, all the way to Mass Avenue, of course,", 
    "the force on this little object will be inversely R", 
    "squared, because then the whole plane would behave like", 
    "a point source.", 
    "So I've shown you that, very close to this plane, the", 
    "electric field stays approximately constant.", 
    "So if now we remove this--", 
    "Marcos, if you've can-- yeah.", 
    "You will have to take this also off.", 
    "Thank you very much.", 
    "So now we have the Van de Graaff alone.", 
    "So now we know that the electric field falls off as 1", 
    "over R squared.", 
    "That's a very good approximation now.", 
    "We can think of the charge as being right at the center.", 
    "I will give it a little bit of charge.", 
    "Oh, it is already charged.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So look at the projection.", 
    "The balloon is now maybe 30 centimeters away from the", 
    "center, maybe 40.", 
    "Oh, the angle is almost 45 degrees.", 
    "And now, I double the distance.", 
    "I go to about 90 centimeters.", 
    "And look at that angle theta.", 
    "The angle theta is now down to maybe 10 degrees.", 
    "I will go back where I was.", 
    "This angle is about 40 degrees.", 
    "And now, it's very small.", 
    "And when I go here, which is about a meter and a half, you", 
    "can hardly see that there's any angle.", 
    "It's only a few degrees.", 
    "And so I've shown you only qualitatively that the", 
    "electric field falls off very rapidly in a vicinity of a", 
    "hollow, uniformly charged sphere, and that it doesn't", 
    "fall off very fast if you are in the near", 
    "vicinity of a plane.", 
    "The second thing I want to show you has to do with the", 
    "fact that the electric field inside a uniformly charged", 
    "sphere is 0.", 
    "Here, I have a sphere, which is not entirely closed.", 
    "I can't make it closed, because I want to demonstrate", 
    "to you that there is no electric field inside when I", 
    "charge it uniformly.", 
    "And since I have to get inside, I need an opening.", 
    "There's nothing I could do about it.", 
    "Since there is an opening, the electric field is", 
    "not exactly 0 inside.", 
    "It's only true if this is a complete closed surface and if", 
    "the charge is uniformly distributed.", 
    "But it's a good approximation.", 
    "The opening is quite small.", 
    "And what I'm going to do is I'm going", 
    "to charge this sphere.", 
    "I'm putting charge outside.", 
    "I'll use a device that we have not used before, but that's", 
    "not so important if here is now that hollow sphere.", 
    "I'm going to put charge on there.", 
    "Let's suppose it is positive charge.", 
    "So this will be positively charged since it is a", 
    "conductor, as we will learn--", 
    "I think the next lecture or at least this week--", 
    "that the charge will automatically distributed", 
    "uniformly--", 
    "only does that on a conductor.", 
    "And now to demonstrate to you that there is an electric", 
    "field here, I will use induction.", 
    "I have two ping pong balls painted with conducting paint.", 
    "They touch each other.", 
    "Under influence of this electric field, this one will", 
    "become negative, and this one will become positive.", 
    "We've discussed last time.", 
    "You create a dipole.", 
    "It's not important that it is a dipole.", 
    "I separate the two.", 
    "I have negative charge here and positive charge there.", 
    "I will touch any one of these two balls-- it doesn't matter", 
    "which one--", 
    "with the electroscope, and you will see that", 
    "there is charge there.", 
    "So I have demonstrated then that there is an electric", 
    "field outside that sphere.", 
    "Now, I will do exactly the same demonstration.", 
    "But now I put these two conducting balls inside.", 
    "So here they are.", 
    "I touch them.", 
    "You just have to trust me that I really will touch them.", 
    "And then I will take them out.", 
    "And if I didn't make a mistake--", 
    "if I didn't touch the rim by accident--", 
    "then I will show you that there is no", 
    "electric field inside.", 
    "It means there's no induction.", 
    "So these balls did not pick up charge.", 
    "I show you with the electroscope that indeed there", 
    "is no charge on it.", 
    "So that is the way I want to do this.", 
    "So there is the electroscope.", 
    "Here is the sphere.", 
    "And the way I'm going to charge it has a nice name.", 
    "It's called electrophorus--", 
    "hard to pronounce.", 
    "I first rub a glass plate with cat fur.", 
    "Then I take a metal plate, I put on top, and I touch it", 
    "with my finger.", 
    "And now I transfer charge.", 
    "And you think about it, why that is.", 
    "I put it on here again, touch it again with my finger.", 
    "I'm again charging it.", 
    "Put it on top, touch it again with my finger.", 
    "I want a little bit more charge, so I'm", 
    "rubbing this again.", 
    "Put this on top, touch it with my finger.", 
    "Every time I do that, I feel a little shock.", 
    "Put it on there.", 
    "Touch it with my finger.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Let's hope that's enough."
