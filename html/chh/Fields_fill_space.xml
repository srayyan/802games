The electrostatic field is a vector field. To detect the presence of an electric field put a small test charge into the field and look for its acceleration. Lines tangent to the acceleration are also tangent to the field vectors. Such lines are called field lines. Electric field lines provide useful maps of electric fields, but their 2-D nature can be misleading. You will often see field lines used to represent a uniform electric field, a dipole field, or the field of a point charge. </html>
