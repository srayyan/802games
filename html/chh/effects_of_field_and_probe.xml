<html source_file="/Users/chholbrow/MOOCs/edX_maker/LaTeX2edX/toyx.tex" display_name="effects of field and probe">To probe an electric field in some volume of space, you want the effects of the gravitational field to be negligible compared to the effects of the electric field. You also don't want the electric field of the charged particle to be so large that it forces the source charges to move and thereby changes the field you are probing. </html>
