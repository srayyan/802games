<h1>TEALSim Exploration: Point Charges</h1>

 <p>
This simulation illustrates the field pattern created by two point charges with opposite signs of charge. In this simulation, the position and charge of each particle can be modified in real time, and the field configuration will update itself accordingly.<br/>
All three field visualization techniques can be applied to show the overall electric field of the two-charge configuration: vector field, field lines, and "grass seeds".
</p>

<p>(Please be patient - the simulation may take ~20 seconds to load)</p>
