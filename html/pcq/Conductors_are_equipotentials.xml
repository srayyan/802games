 <h2> Conductors </h2>
<p>An object is called a conductor because charges are able to move freely in it and through it.
The substance conducts the charges from one place to another. Metals are good conductors; charges move
 easily in metals.  The charges that move in metals are electrons.  Because the charges move freely 
 there can be no electrostatic field
inside a conductor. As soon as a field is present the charges redistribute themselves until they
cancel the electric field. The end result is a layer of charge on the surfaces of the conductor. 
</p> 

<p>Notice, though, there cannot be any component of the electrostatic field
parallel to the surface of a conductor.  As soon as such a component occurs, it moves the surface
charges around until they cancel out the component.
</p>

<p> Therefore, the surface of a conductor is an equipotential, and the electric field from the surface 
charge is always perpendicular to the surface.  These two statements are equivalent because electric 
field is always perpendicular to equipotentials.
