<p>The surface integral of a vector field over an area is called 'flux'. This surface integral is important because it provides a useful 
connection between the distribution of field intensity over a closed surface and the charge inside that surface. 
The word &#x2018;flux' was first used in studies of velocity fields where there was an actual flow of matter 
across a surface. In electrostatics nothing is flowing, but electric flux is still the name used for this 
surface integral. This integral is often written as [mathjaxinline]\int \! \! \! \int _{\rm S} \vec{E} 
\cdot d\vec{A}[/mathjaxinline]; it is also written as [mathjaxinline]\int _{\rm S} \vec{E} 
\cdot d\vec{A}.[/mathjaxinline] A circle on the integral sign, [mathjaxinline]\oint _{\rm S} \vec{E} \cdot 
d\vec{A}[/mathjaxinline], means that the surface integration is over a closed surface.
