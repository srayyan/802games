 <h2> Gauss tests Coulomb </h2>
  <p>
Gauss' Law would not be true if the exponent in Coulomb's [mathjaxinline]1/r^2[/mathjaxinline] 
Law were not exactly [mathjaxinline]2[/mathjaxinline]. Consequently, when Faraday used an 
ice pail to show that all the charge inside a metal container will go to the outermost 
surface he was testing both Gauss' Law and Coulomb's law. Refined versions of his ice-pail 
experiment show that for [mathjaxinline]1/r^{2+\delta }[/mathjaxinline], 
[mathjaxinline]\delta = 0[/mathjaxinline] to parts in [mathjaxinline]10^{16}[/mathjaxinline]. </p>
