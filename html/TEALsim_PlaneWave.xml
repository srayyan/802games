<h1>TEALSim Exploration: Plane Wave</h1>

 <p>
The EM Radiator is a simulation of how to generate plane electromagnetic  
			waves by shaking a sheet of positive electric charge (the pink sheet).
			When the &quot;Motion On&quot; box is CHECKED,
			the sheet is automatically shaken up and
			down sinsoidally.  When the &quot;Motion On&quot; box is UNCHECKED,
			the user shakes the sheet up and down by left clicking on the silver ball and moving the mouse
			up and down.</p>
        <p>The black line perpendicular to the pink sheet of charge represents a field line of the total electric field of the sheet
        	(the static field plus the radiation field).  The orange arrows represent the radiation electric
        	field (without the static field).  The blue arrows represent the radiation magnetic field

		<h1>View Controls:</h1>
		<p>The view controls are as follows.  To rotate, <i>left-click and drag</i> in the view window.
		To translate the view perpendicular to the camera view, <i>right-click and drag</i> in the view window.
		To zoom in and out, <i>alt-left-click and drag</i> in the view window or <i>middle-button-click and drag</i>. </p>


<p>(Please be patient - the simulation may take ~20 seconds to load)</p>

         	<p>This JavaScript simulation illustrates the field
	 pattern created by two point charges with opposite signs of charge. In this simulation,
	 the position and charge of each particle can be modified in real time, and the field
	 configuration will update itself accordingly.

	All three field visualization techniques can be applied to show the overall electric
	field of the two-charge configuration: vector field, field lines, and "grass seeds".</p>

<p>Click and drag using the left mouse button to rotate. Click and drag using the right mouse button (or use SHIFT + left mouse button) to change the center of view. And click and drag using the mouse wheel (or use CTRL + left mouse button) to zoom in/out. The two spheres can be selected and dragged.
