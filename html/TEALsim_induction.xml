<h1>TEALSim Exploration: Charge by Induction</h1>

<p>
We have an equal number of positive (orange) and negative (blue)
charges distributed between two cylindrical barriers which they cannot
cross.  We can control the amount of charge on a central charge which
is interior to the innermost of the two cylinders.  In the image
shown, the  central charge is neutral (silver) but with the slider we
can make it positive (orange) or negative (blue).

<p>(Please be patient - the simulation may take ~20 seconds to load)</p>

         	<p>This JavaScript simulation illustrates the field
	 pattern created by two point charges with opposite signs of charge. In this simulation,
	 the position and charge of each particle can be modified in real time, and the field
	 configuration will update itself accordingly.

	All three field visualization techniques can be applied to show the overall electric
	field of the two-charge configuration: vector field, field lines, and "grass seeds".</p>

<p>Click and drag using the left mouse button to rotate. Click and drag using the right mouse button (or use SHIFT + left mouse button) to change the center of view. And click and drag using the mouse wheel (or use CTRL + left mouse button) to zoom in/out. The two spheres can be selected and dragged.
