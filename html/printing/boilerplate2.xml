Problem Set 2</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Due: Tuesday, February 18 at 9 pm.</p>

<p>If you are in a M/W/F class for 8.02, you will need to register for the course “8.02r-MW Electricity and Magnetism (Monday and Wednesday)”.  If you are in a Tuesday/Thursday/Friday class for 8.02, register for “8.02r-TTh: Electricity and Magnetism (Tuesday and Thursday)”.  The following link will get you to either course and the web site will require certificates:  <a href="https://lms.mitx.mit.edu/">https://lms.mitx.mit.edu/</a>.</p>

<p>Submit the two online problems in this set (problems 1 and 2) online. Hand in the six written problems in this set (problems 3-8) in your section slot in the boxes outside the door of 32-082 or 26-152 depending on which is your classroom. Make sure you clearly write your name and section on your problem set.</p>
