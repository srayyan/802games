<h2>About this section</h2>
</p>
<p>
This section of the website has videos of Walter Lewin solving problems similar to those you'll encounter in this course (they were originally made for the edX course 8.02x). Where applicable, we'll link to these problem solving videos when they show similar techniques to what you'll need to solve problems in the problem sets. You are also welcome to watch the videos at your own leisure.
