    <p>
An isotope of aluminum which is singly charged moves in the crossed electric and magnetic fields of the velocity selector of a mass spectrometer. The magnitude of the electric field is [mathjaxinline]E[/mathjaxinline] and of the magnetic field [mathjaxinline]B[/mathjaxinline]. What is the velocity that is selected by this arrangement? The ion then moves into a region with a magnetic field of the same magnitude, and with no electric field, and subsequently moves in a circle of radius [mathjaxinline]R[/mathjaxinline] meters. What is the mass of this aluminum ion in terms of the quantities given? </p>
