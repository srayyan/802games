    <p>
A loop with current [mathjaxinline]I[/mathjaxinline] is made up of two semi-circles of radii [mathjaxinline]a[/mathjaxinline] and [mathjaxinline]b[/mathjaxinline] with [mathjaxinline]b &gt; a[/mathjaxinline]. The semi-circles have the same center. The current moves clockwise on the larger semi-circle and counterclockwise on the smaller semi-circle. The circuit is completed by radial segments of wire between the ends of the semi-circles. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the semi-circles?

 Note that there is a typo at 4:09 (in speed 1.0) where Prof. Lewin writes 2[mathjaxinline]\pi R[/mathjaxinline] instead of [mathjaxinline]\pi R[/mathjaxinline].</p>
