A circuit consists of three batteries and six resistors, arranged in two loops as shown. Two of the batteries have unknown voltages, [mathjaxinline]\mathcal{E}_1[/mathjaxinline] and [mathjaxinline]\mathcal{E}_2[/mathjaxinline]. Given that the currents in the top and bottom loops are 1 Amp and 2 Amps, respectively, in the directions shown in the figure,  solve for the two unknown battery voltages. </p>
