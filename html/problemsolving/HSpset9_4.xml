    <p>
A source of luminosity [mathjaxinline]L[/mathjaxinline] exerts a radiation pressure on a cross sectional area [mathjaxinline]dA[/mathjaxinline] at a distance [mathjaxinline]R[/mathjaxinline] from the source. What is this radiation pressure assuming total absorption of the radiation? How is this related to the Poynting flux? If the light is totally reflected, instead of absorbed, how does this pressure change? </p>
