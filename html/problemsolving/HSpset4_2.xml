    <p>
An electron moves with a speed [mathjaxinline]v[/mathjaxinline] in a clock-wise direction around a semi-circle of radius [mathjaxinline]R[/mathjaxinline] in a magnetic field. What is the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field that causes this motion? What is the time it takes for the electron to traverse the semi-circular path?
