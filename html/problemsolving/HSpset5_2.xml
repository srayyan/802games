    <p>
A square loop of side [mathjaxinline]L[/mathjaxinline] has resistance [mathjaxinline]R[/mathjaxinline] and moves at constant speed [mathjaxinline]v[/mathjaxinline] to the right in the plane of the page. It moves from a field free region into a region where the magnetic field is into the page and constant. This region of non-zero field is a square with sides of length [mathjaxinline]2L[/mathjaxinline], and the magnetic field strength in this region is [mathjaxinline]B[/mathjaxinline]. Find the external force required to move this loop at constant speed into, through, and then out of this region of non-zero field. This can be done in several ways. Also, sketch a graph of the induced current in the circuit as a function of the position of the loop. </p>
