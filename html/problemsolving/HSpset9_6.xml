    <p>
The total power output of the Sun is [mathjaxinline]\sim 4 \times 10^{26}
[/mathjaxinline] Watts (a NASA fact sheet lists [mathjaxinline]3.846\times 
10^{26}[/mathjaxinline]). How large a 100% reflective sail is necessary to propel 
a [mathjaxinline]5000[/mathjaxinline] kilogram spacecraft against the 
gravitational force of the Sun? Does the size depend on the distance from the
Sun?

<p> 
Using the same mathematics, compute the minimum 
radius of a grain of sand which can survive in the solar system (i.e. 
would not be blown out by solar radiation pressure). 
Assume a density of 2.5 gm/cm
[mathjaxinline]^3[/mathjaxinline]. Note that the sand would be 
more absorptive than reflective.
