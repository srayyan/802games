    <p>
We distribute a total charge [mathjaxinline]Q[/mathjaxinline] uniformly on a thin insulating rod bent into a semi-circle of radius [mathjaxinline]a[/mathjaxinline]. Calculate the electric potential (covered during Week 2) at the center of radius of the semi-circle. Calculate the electric field (covered during Week 1) at the same point.</p>
