    <p>
An electron is shot at [mathjaxinline]t = 0[/mathjaxinline] with a speed of [mathjaxinline]v = 2.5\times 10^6[/mathjaxinline] meters/second into a homogeneous [mathjaxinline]\vec E[/mathjaxinline] field of [mathjaxinline]10^3[/mathjaxinline] Newtons/Coulomb. The field is along the same axis as the velocity and points in the direction that causes the electron to slow down. </p>
    <ul class="itemize">
      <li>
        <p>
Make a sketch showing the relative directions of [mathjaxinline]\vec E[/mathjaxinline] and [mathjaxinline]\vec v[/mathjaxinline]. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
How far in its initial direction will the electron travel before it comes to a stop? </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
How long a time will it take for the electron to return to its original position? </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
Suppose now that the [mathjaxinline]\vec E[/mathjaxinline] field ends after only [mathjaxinline]10[/mathjaxinline] millimeters. What fraction of the electron's kinetic energy was lost in passing through the field? </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
