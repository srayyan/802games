    <p>
A solid cylindrical metal conductor has radius [mathjaxinline]a[/mathjaxinline]. It is surrounded by a cylindrical conducting metal shell with inner radius [mathjaxinline]b[/mathjaxinline] and outer radius [mathjaxinline]c[/mathjaxinline], with [mathjaxinline]a &lt; b &lt; c[/mathjaxinline]. The inner conductor carries a current [mathjaxinline]I_1[/mathjaxinline] and the outer cylindrical shell carries a current [mathjaxinline]I_2[/mathjaxinline] in the same direction, both into the page. The currents are uniformly distributed over the conductors through which they flow. What is the magnetic field everywhere in space? </p>
