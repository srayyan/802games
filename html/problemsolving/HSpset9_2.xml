    <p>
A standing electromagnetic wave has a frequency of [mathjaxinline]600 \times 10^6[/mathjaxinline] Hz. It is positioned between two conducting planes a distance of [mathjaxinline]75[/mathjaxinline] centimeters apart. At what positions between the planes could a point charge be placed at rest so that it would remain at rest? What is the Poynting vector for a standing wave? </p>
