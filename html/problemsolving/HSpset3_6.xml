A set of 5 resistors, a 36 Volt battery, and a switch are arranged in a circuit with two loops as shown. All resistances are in ohms even though the symbol is not shown everywhere. Initially the switch is open, and then it is closed.  Find the current in all branches of the circuits both before and after the switch is closed. </p>
