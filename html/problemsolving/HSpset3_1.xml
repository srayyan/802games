A circuit contains four capacitors [mathjaxinline]C_1, C_2, C_3[/mathjaxinline], and [mathjaxinline]C_4[/mathjaxinline]
in series and in parallel as shown in the figure. The voltage from point [mathjaxinline]a[/mathjaxinline]
to point [mathjaxinline]b[/mathjaxinline] is [mathjaxinline]V[/mathjaxinline].
Find the charge on each capacitor and potential difference across each capacitor in terms of [mathjaxinline]V[/mathjaxinline] 
and the given capacitances. </p>
<p>
Note that Prof. Lewin starts this session by solving for equivalent capacitances in the cases of two capacitors in series or in parallel.
